[14.5s - 15.7s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Jackie. How you doing today?

[18.6s - 19.0s] (Chunk 002)
Okay.

[20.0s - 24.7s] (Chunk 003)
I understand you've had some recent difficulties that have brought you in here today.

[33.1s - 35.8s] (Chunk 004)
So why do you think she did that?

[69.7s - 72.5s] (Chunk 005)
So you believe you have a physical illness?

[76.5s - 80.7s] (Chunk 006)
And your physician has run a series of tests, too?

[92.8s - 100.7s] (Chunk 007)
So what was her. Other than coming to see me, what was her suggestion for treatment? So she ran tests, she didn't find anything?

[107.2s - 109.2s] (Chunk 008)
So she's saying there's no physical illness?

[111.5s - 112.4s] (Chunk 009)
You're not as sure?

[116.0s - 121.7s] (Chunk 010)
So how long have you believed that you had a physical illness?

[135.4s - 145.6s] (Chunk 011)
So about a year ago, you went to her, she started running tests, and there was no findings of a disorder?

[148.2s - 151.6s] (Chunk 012)
Was it just one disorder that you thought you had, or have there been several?

[191.9s - 192.6s] (Chunk 013)
You think it's cancer?

[208.8s - 213.5s] (Chunk 014)
Your physicians run tests for all these disorders you thought you had. What do you think you have?

[224.9s - 225.8s] (Chunk 015)
So you're worried.

[229.4s - 238.4s] (Chunk 016)
So you saw the physician for the first time regarding this a year ago. Did you have anxiety or worry before that?

[249.4s - 253.5s] (Chunk 017)
But you were worried about the illness? Nothing else, though?

[257.6s - 261.4s] (Chunk 018)
Do you have any physical symptoms?

[276.0s - 281.4s] (Chunk 019)
Do you find yourself checking often to see if you have physical symptoms or.

[295.1s - 300.0s] (Chunk 020)
So are you active on the Internet forums where they discuss illnesses?

[321.0s - 323.6s] (Chunk 021)
So you read. You read the form slot? Do you ever post?

[332.0s - 332.8s] (Chunk 022)
Tell me about that.

[353.2s - 356.3s] (Chunk 023)
What would you like us to do here at the agency?

[372.0s - 376.8s] (Chunk 024)
You're worried you have a physical. A physical health disorder. Are you worried that you have a mental health disorder?

[384.4s - 385.5s] (Chunk 025)
Are you worried about that?

[399.0s - 403.0s] (Chunk 026)
So you're concerned that the worry could be a symptom of a physical illness.

[406.6s - 413.8s] (Chunk 027)
So again, what would your. What would your goal be here? What do you want? What do you Want to change through calcium.

[421.7s - 423.3s] (Chunk 028)
You want to worry less?

[435.9s - 457.1s] (Chunk 029)
All right, so you have. You've had worry for at least a year, specifically about being physically ill. There have been no findings of physical illness, but you're still worried about it, and you might be a little worried that you have a mental health disorder.

[461.9s - 474.8s] (Chunk 030)
Something might be going on, and you want to be able to stop worrying about the physical health disorders. Yeah. All right. Are you worried right now that you have a physical health to sweater?

[477.1s - 478.7s] (Chunk 031)
What disorder do you think you might have now?

[487.3s - 490.5s] (Chunk 032)
And you've been tested for this by your physician?

[495.5s - 504.8s] (Chunk 033)
So are you ever reassured when you get negative test results back, when they say there's nothing going on?

[530.3s - 533.0s] (Chunk 034)
You want her to rerun tests? Yeah, and I look again.

[536.1s - 540.8s] (Chunk 035)
All right. So you're open to counseling here?

[552.6s - 556.4s] (Chunk 036)
Would you be okay signing a release so that I could talk to your physician?

[558.4s - 566.6s] (Chunk 037)
All right, so I'll get you scheduled now. I'll schedule you either way whether you want to sign a release or not.

[567.1s - 571.7s] (Chunk 038)
But that's just something I think might be helpful for me to better understand what's going on.

[572.6s - 577.8s] (Chunk 039)
But I'll get you in to see a counselor. It'll just take a couple days. We'll get that worked out now.

[578.5s - 578.9s] (Chunk 040)
All right.

[579.5s - 579.9s] (Chunk 041)
