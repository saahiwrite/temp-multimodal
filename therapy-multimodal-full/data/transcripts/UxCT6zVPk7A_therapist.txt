[14.7s - 18.0s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Jason. How you doing today? I'm here. You're good?

[22.1s - 22.7s] (Chunk 002)
You're here?

[24.2s - 25.3s] (Chunk 003)
What's been going on?

[46.7s - 49.3s] (Chunk 004)
Do you know what you're charged with?

[58.5s - 61.9s] (Chunk 005)
The government? Do you have anybody specific? Nope.

[63.1s - 63.8s] (Chunk 006)
The entire government.

[66.2s - 70.3s] (Chunk 007)
How long have they been wanting to do this to you?

[79.3s - 80.1s] (Chunk 008)
Always there.

[93.4s - 95.0s] (Chunk 009)
You've been taking medications?

[114.7s - 117.8s] (Chunk 010)
Do you know what they want to do with that information?

[121.9s - 122.9s] (Chunk 011)
To take over the world.

[147.2s - 151.1s] (Chunk 012)
So what can you do in this situation?

[155.3s - 166.3s] (Chunk 013)
Well, you say the government's monitoring everything and that they want to put you in jail if you don't take your medication. Do you have any options? Are you stuck?

[181.2s - 185.3s] (Chunk 014)
So one option is that being home, being home, you're safe.

[196.7s - 197.6s] (Chunk 015)
Are you safe here?

[208.5s - 212.5s] (Chunk 016)
So it's not safe here. It's not safe out in the world. At home, you're safe at home.

[216.6s - 222.5s] (Chunk 017)
So if you could have your way, you would just stay home most of the time? All the time.

[245.2s - 250.2s] (Chunk 018)
So how do you know that they're in the lights? How did you discover that?

[253.7s - 254.7s] (Chunk 019)
It's common knowledge.

[258.2s - 263.8s] (Chunk 020)
Do you ever hear things that other people can't hear or see things other people can't see?

[281.7s - 282.5s] (Chunk 021)
Everybody can hear it.

[282.9s - 284.0s] (Chunk 022)
What's it sound like to you?

[294.1s - 302.1s] (Chunk 023)
Oh, just making some notes. Just making some progress notes. Is it? Where are you?

[308.6s - 312.3s] (Chunk 024)
They get well, this chart will get locked in the chart room down the hall.

[315.9s - 317.4s] (Chunk 025)
Mostly everybody works here.

[324.8s - 326.5s] (Chunk 026)
Does it worry that there's notes?

[359.3s - 365.2s] (Chunk 027)
I cannot take notes. What kind of information and notes are you worried that the government's going to get?

[385.6s - 390.6s] (Chunk 028)
So without the protection that your house offers, they could control your mind?

[407.3s - 426.7s] (Chunk 029)
All right, so can you tell me about your mood through all this? So this sounds really stressful. You're describing an environment where the government's frequently looking at what you're doing. What are the feelings there? You feel sad or angry?

[428.2s - 429.1s] (Chunk 030)
You feel fine?

[440.2s - 444.2s] (Chunk 031)
Kind of resigned that the government's gonna do this.

[460.6s - 465.0s] (Chunk 032)
Are you worried that something is going to happen that's similar to what happened on the bus?

[486.4s - 495.7s] (Chunk 033)
So you'll avoid that in the future because it didn't really work. Yes, you weren't able to help them understand what's going on.

[510.8s - 515.4s] (Chunk 034)
But they weren't open to that idea. No, quite the opposite.

[519.1s - 524.5s] (Chunk 035)
How are your family relationships? How's that going?

[525.8s - 526.2s] (Chunk 036)
Yeah.

[537.4s - 538.7s] (Chunk 037)
So you get along with her okay?

[540.8s - 546.0s] (Chunk 038)
Yeah. Anybody else you have contact with? Friends, family?

[566.5s - 591.7s] (Chunk 039)
All right, Jason. Well, I'm sorry to hear that you're under stress. I'm glad to hear you feel like your mood's okay. You're not down or anxious or anything, answering these questions for me, this has been helpful, and I'm going to recommend you continue to see a counselor here, if that's okay. I realize you're court ordered.

[594.6s - 595.5s] (Chunk 040)
It could be me.

[596.0s - 597.1s] (Chunk 041)
Would that make you feel more comfortable?

[600.5s - 609.0s] (Chunk 042)
Well, then I'll put on the schedule. We'll set a time up front where I'll see you, let's say, in three days. That works.

[611.4s - 612.5s] (Chunk 043)
And we'll go from there.

[613.8s - 614.5s] (Chunk 044)
Thanks, Jason.
