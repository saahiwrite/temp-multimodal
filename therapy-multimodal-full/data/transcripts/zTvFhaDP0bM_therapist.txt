[14.2s - 15.3s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Lisa. How you doing today?

[18.2s - 19.0s] (Chunk 002)
Doing pretty good.

[28.8s - 30.2s] (Chunk 003)
Like college? Yeah.

[46.8s - 47.7s] (Chunk 004)
Adhd?

[48.8s - 57.0s] (Chunk 005)
I think you may have adhd. All right. Is it. Are these symptoms bothering you? You said you go to college online.

[58.0s - 59.2s] (Chunk 006)
Is it bothering you there?

[61.9s - 69.0s] (Chunk 007)
It does. All right, I'm gonna ask you a few questions. Try to get a better understand what's going on.

[70.9s - 73.9s] (Chunk 008)
These symptoms you've been having, at what age did they start?

[76.1s - 84.8s] (Chunk 009)
Eight years old. All right. And you feel like they're bothering you with your classes that you take online?

[86.9s - 111.8s] (Chunk 010)
You still get good grades? Yeah. So let me ask you some questions about that. So I'll specifically be asking about how it affects you in class, but if it affects you in any other area, tell me about that too. Okay. All right. Do you have trouble establishing attention? Yes. When you have established attention, do you have difficulty holding attention?

[115.7s - 121.4s] (Chunk 011)
Do you, for example, with the professor. Do you listen to the professor in your online classes?

[124.1s - 129.5s] (Chunk 012)
That's a problem for you? How about following through on any instructions the professor gives you?

[132.6s - 133.6s] (Chunk 013)
Are you organized?

[135.6s - 142.3s] (Chunk 014)
You are organized. Do you find yourself avoiding activities that require a lot of mental effort?

[143.9s - 145.6s] (Chunk 015)
What type of activities do you avoid?

[150.4s - 151.0s] (Chunk 016)
Chess?

[158.1s - 164.3s] (Chunk 017)
Do you ever find yourself losing things that you need for class or any other place?

[165.0s - 168.1s] (Chunk 018)
Yeah. Are you easily distracted?

[171.4s - 172.4s] (Chunk 019)
Are you forgetful?

[173.2s - 184.8s] (Chunk 020)
Yeah. All right, so I'm going to move to another series of questions. Do you fidget?

[185.8s - 190.2s] (Chunk 021)
You do? I do. Do you find it difficult to stay in your seat?

[205.0s - 208.8s] (Chunk 022)
Okay. So you feel kind of compelled to stand up and walk around? Yeah.

[209.1s - 211.3s] (Chunk 023)
And then you can sit down and resume.

[214.4s - 217.2s] (Chunk 024)
How do you do with quiet activities like reading?

[223.8s - 230.7s] (Chunk 025)
No. No. You ever feel like you have an internal motor that's always running?

[234.9s - 239.7s] (Chunk 026)
How about talking? You find that you talk excessively?

[244.4s - 245.8s] (Chunk 027)
How about blurting things out?

[254.9s - 265.7s] (Chunk 028)
And you have to hit a button so that I get hurt. Turns on and the audio turns on. So you'll blurt something out, but they won't hear it. Yeah, they won't, because you haven't.

[266.6s - 272.2s] (Chunk 029)
That's that key. Okay. How about interrupting people?

[273.5s - 274.0s] (Chunk 030)
Yeah.

[275.7s - 277.5s] (Chunk 031)
Do you have trouble waiting your turn?

[290.9s - 293.9s] (Chunk 032)
Okay. That's not a strong suit for you?

[298.0s - 320.1s] (Chunk 033)
Okay. So you mentioned that this is causing some difficulty in school, but you also said that you're doing okay in school. Yeah. Is there any other area of your life where this is causing you problems?

[327.0s - 332.6s] (Chunk 034)
What else do you do? So you go to college? Yeah. What activities do you engage in?

[341.1s - 341.2s] (Chunk 035)
Really?

[342.1s - 342.4s] (Chunk 036)
I mean.

[344.2s - 345.9s] (Chunk 037)
How about, like, relatives?

[354.8s - 356.4s] (Chunk 038)
I don't see them. How about friends?

[363.3s - 366.3s] (Chunk 039)
Do you ever socialize with any of your classmates from college?

[367.1s - 376.0s] (Chunk 040)
No? No. Do you feel that's because of these symptoms or that you wouldn't anyway?

[387.1s - 396.2s] (Chunk 041)
All right. Do you. Do you think it's hard for you to engage with your classmates socially because of any concentration or hyperactivity type symptoms?

[398.0s - 408.4s] (Chunk 042)
You believe it is because of those symptoms? Yeah. And any other areas like shopping or cleaning the house?

[410.5s - 411.5s] (Chunk 043)
That works out okay.

[415.0s - 429.3s] (Chunk 044)
Okay. At least I'm gonna get you in to see a counselor. It'll just take a couple days to get you in. Right. So I set an appointment for a couple days out. I appreciate you spending this time with me and let me ask these questions. This was helpful.

[430.6s - 431.0s] (Chunk 045)
Thanks.
