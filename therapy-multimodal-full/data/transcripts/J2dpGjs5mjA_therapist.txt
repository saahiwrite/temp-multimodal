[14.3s - 15.4s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Sarah, how you doing today?

[20.1s - 21.1s] (Chunk 002)
You doing all right today?

[23.4s - 31.3s] (Chunk 003)
I understand that you've been having some symptoms and that's what has brought you into our agency. Could you tell me about that?

[34.3s - 35.0s] (Chunk 004)
A lot of worry?

[41.3s - 43.3s] (Chunk 005)
Maybe about four or five months.

[67.4s - 73.9s] (Chunk 006)
All right, so a lot of worry. Some are at four or five or six months.

[77.3s - 84.4s] (Chunk 007)
Have you had this worry more days than you haven't had it in that last four to six months?

[93.3s - 94.1s] (Chunk 008)
Not quite sure.

[97.4s - 100.5s] (Chunk 009)
Do you find the worry difficult to control.

[108.3s - 122.2s] (Chunk 010)
So I'm going to ask you some questions related to this. Let me know if you've experienced these symptoms. Do you feel restless, keyed up or on edge?

[124.2s - 127.5s] (Chunk 011)
Okay, how about, are you easily tired?

[130.6s - 131.5s] (Chunk 012)
Yeah, all the time.

[132.4s - 136.0s] (Chunk 013)
You have trouble concentrating or finding your mind going blank?

[141.3s - 145.4s] (Chunk 014)
Okay. Do you find that you've been irritable?

[148.3s - 149.7s] (Chunk 015)
Any muscle tension?

[152.5s - 154.1s] (Chunk 016)
And tell me about how you've been sleeping.

[167.1s - 170.1s] (Chunk 017)
Do you drink alcohol or use any drugs?

[170.9s - 174.0s] (Chunk 018)
No. Have you ever had a panic attack?

[174.9s - 176.1s] (Chunk 019)
Any trauma in your history?

[176.8s - 178.4s] (Chunk 020)
Any mental health disorders at all?

[182.0s - 185.8s] (Chunk 021)
You find the symptoms very distressing?

[187.9s - 190.5s] (Chunk 022)
Yes. In what areas are they distressing?

[196.4s - 197.1s] (Chunk 023)
School's okay.

[199.8s - 200.9s] (Chunk 024)
Wow. Very good.

[206.9s - 209.0s] (Chunk 025)
How about when you go out with friends?

[213.8s - 223.8s] (Chunk 026)
Is there something specific to your home environment you think might be contributing to this? Because you don't have it at school, you don't have it socially? Eh.

[226.9s - 233.6s] (Chunk 027)
Some problems here and there. Nothing you could isolate as maybe causing.

[239.4s - 256.2s] (Chunk 028)
Nothing you can't work through. All right, Sarah, I'm gonna get you in to see one of our counselors, if that's okay with you. Just take a couple days for you to get in, get an appointment set, and for you to get in. Is that okay?

[258.6s - 264.6s] (Chunk 029)
Okay, I'll get that set up. And I want to thank you for answering these questions. This has been really helpful to me.
