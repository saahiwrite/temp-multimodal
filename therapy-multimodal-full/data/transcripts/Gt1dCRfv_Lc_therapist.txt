[14.6s - 15.7s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Sherry. How you doing today?

[17.6s - 18.6s] (Chunk 002)
You're doing okay.

[19.7s - 25.2s] (Chunk 003)
I understand your father brought you in today. He was a little worried about how you might be feeling.

[33.1s - 40.7s] (Chunk 004)
Yeah. He had mentioned that you had some concerns about some things going on in your neighborhood and that you called the police a few times.

[42.1s - 43.2s] (Chunk 005)
He told me about that.

[62.3s - 72.2s] (Chunk 006)
So you're not depressed? More concerned. So what's going on where you live that's leading to these feelings?

[94.8s - 99.9s] (Chunk 007)
So you believe the government is apprehending people in the area where you live?

[100.7s - 101.5s] (Chunk 008)
You know they are?

[102.9s - 107.9s] (Chunk 009)
And did you see things that specifically led you to believe this?

[131.6s - 132.9s] (Chunk 010)
The police are in on it, too?

[143.7s - 157.6s] (Chunk 011)
So they investigated what you saw, and they came back and told you that they pretended to. They pretended to investigate? Yeah. And they came back and. And told you everything was okay, but you're. You're not.

[180.4s - 203.2s] (Chunk 012)
They're in on the. What the government's been doing. So what do you think of your father's concerns? He's concerned that you were down, you're depressed, and that your thinking hasn't been clear. What do you think about his concerns?

[245.4s - 245.9s] (Chunk 013)
You know.

[262.7s - 264.3s] (Chunk 014)
You're not. You're not depressed?

[286.8s - 289.4s] (Chunk 015)
And how long has this been going on.

[294.4s - 302.3s] (Chunk 016)
A few months. Is that when you first saw what you. What you believe to be the kidnapping?

[304.1s - 311.6s] (Chunk 017)
That was a few months ago. Were there any beliefs like this before two months?

[346.1s - 355.5s] (Chunk 018)
All right, so you felt this way for a while, but seeing what you saw two months ago, that made you more sure?

[358.5s - 364.4s] (Chunk 019)
Because now you have proof. Have you ever been treated for depression in the past?

[395.3s - 401.8s] (Chunk 020)
What have the people at the places where he has taken you, what have they said about your condition?

[418.5s - 419.9s] (Chunk 021)
You just play along with it?

[430.3s - 434.8s] (Chunk 022)
So you think they want to like discredit. Discredit you?

[461.9s - 471.7s] (Chunk 023)
Because you know what's going on. That's what's led to all these occurrences. This has led to the symptoms?

[509.7s - 511.5s] (Chunk 024)
So you. So you kind of play along.

[517.2s - 524.7s] (Chunk 025)
Alright. So do you ever have any thoughts related to death or dying or anything like that?

[532.0s - 533.0s] (Chunk 026)
You're worried about what?

[552.2s - 555.5s] (Chunk 027)
That would be more proof that what you've seen is real.

[572.5s - 579.3s] (Chunk 028)
About it in that way. Alright, how about any drug or alcohol abuse or anything like that?

[581.8s - 584.0s] (Chunk 029)

You can play along. Sherry, I want to thank you for answering these questions. I know this is a tough experience for you and have a tough time with everything that's going on that you've described.
