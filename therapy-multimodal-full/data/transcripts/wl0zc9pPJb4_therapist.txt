[5.0s - 7.6s] (Chunk 001)
Good afternoon, Lily. I'm glad you could make it in today.

[10.2s - 11.8s] (Chunk 002)
How's your week been so far?

[14.8s - 27.0s] (Chunk 003)
Yes. Last week when you were in, you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety, and we had developed a plan, a plan for your anxiety. And according to my notes.

[31.5s - 51.1s] (Chunk 004)
Going to look into some yoga classes. You were going to attempt to drink less coffee, you were going to get out more with people, because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home, and you were going to spend more time in nature. So I'm wondering how all that went.

[81.5s - 109.6s] (Chunk 005)
Okay, so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals. You did at least look into yoga, even though the gym didn't have yoga classes. You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one. And you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk. But it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue and getting out more with people.

[118.0s - 127.3s] (Chunk 006)
So it's uncomfortable for you to be out around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking. And how does that make you feel?

[136.8s - 144.7s] (Chunk 007)
Okay, so actually, getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious. So I'm wondering what we could do about that.

[151.2s - 159.6s] (Chunk 008)
Mm, that would absolutely be one option. You could invite people over to your house, and then you could get to choose who you're around.

[163.4s - 174.2s] (Chunk 009)
And in terms of the yoga. Let's get back to the yoga for a minute. Tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes.

[188.4s - 197.5s] (Chunk 010)
And so if I were to ask you right now, how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to ten?

[201.5s - 206.8s] (Chunk 011)
Okay. And so what made you say five or six rather than two or three?

[222.9s - 233.6s] (Chunk 012)
So when you see the pictures on your news feed, it makes you excited about doing it, but when you actually go to do it, it makes it a little bit more challenging.

[241.3s - 249.8s] (Chunk 013)
Mm. And so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people? I'm wondering if that's what yoga is about. Flexibility.

[258.1s - 263.9s] (Chunk 014)
Mm. So you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest?

[264.8s - 266.0s] (Chunk 015)
And you'd be a beginner?

[269.6s - 274.7s] (Chunk 016)
Okay, so what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class?

[288.4s - 298.5s] (Chunk 017)
Okay, so you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain poses? And how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class?

[302.5s - 309.2s] (Chunk 018)
And so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class?

[317.2s - 323.6s] (Chunk 019)
What would cause you to not be able to do it with the poses?

[326.2s - 344.7s] (Chunk 020)
Okay. I remember when you first came in last week, you told me that when you were younger, you used to be very, very flexible. And I'm wondering what would make that difference between then and now?

[359.5s - 367.9s] (Chunk 021)
And how would it Be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed.

[375.1s - 381.2s] (Chunk 022)
What would be the payoff, do you think, if you put up with a little bit of embarrassment?

[386.4s - 414.9s] (Chunk 023)
You know, I can give you. I have lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga, and their anxiety went way down. As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. So I'm not sure if you were. If you knew that or not.

[425.1s - 428.9s] (Chunk 024)
So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to ten?

[438.2s - 463.6s] (Chunk 025)
Good, good. That's a definite improvement. And you could determine after that first class whether your anxiety levels had decreased or not. And would that be validation for you, or would that be. Give you even more motivation? If your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class, I think that.

[468.5s - 481.5s] (Chunk 026)
So one other thing that I wanted to mention to you was you said that you had walked your dog in nature. And I'm curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature.

[492.5s - 498.3s] (Chunk 027)
And so because of it was cold and windy, you decided to kind of cut the walk short.

[499.6s - 509.3s] (Chunk 028)
And that's definitely understandable. I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day.

[514.7s - 517.5s] (Chunk 029)
Okay. So if you took a jacket in case it's cold.

[519.2s - 529.5s] (Chunk 030)
And do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful that you could be in that would help you even more enjoy it?

[535.3s - 535.9s] (Chunk 031)
Okay.

[538.7s - 556.0s] (Chunk 032)
Okay, excellent. It's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise. And so do you think you could commit to an hour? Probably and on a scale of 1 to 10, tell me what that probably means.

[560.5s - 591.3s] (Chunk 033)
That. Okay. All right. So it sounds like last week you had a few problems carrying out the assignments towards decreasing your anxiety. You really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes. But you. You already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you, so you could actually do them at home. How strongly do you feel about doing them at home?

[597.5s - 598.1s] (Chunk 034)
Mm.

[600.8s - 651.4s] (Chunk 035)
And then there would be no embarrassment factor if you couldn't do the poses. Less coffee. You've gone from two cups to one cup. That's very good. Get out more with people. You've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people. Not knowing who's going to be in your space. That's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know. You have no control over who's going to be in your space. And on a scale of 1 to 10, you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog. Good job. I think we have a plan. So, overall, on all four of these items, how motivated do you feel on a scale of 1 to 10?

[653.6s - 655.8s] (Chunk 036)
I think I can do them on all four.

[658.2s - 675.2s] (Chunk 037)
Fabulous. And how do you think you will feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week? Over the course of next week, how much of a difference do you think it would make you feel?

[683.6s - 685.2s] (Chunk 038)
And how would it make you feel?

[688.2s - 696.2s] (Chunk 039)
And so you'd feel relaxed and you would feel more positive, and I think you would, too.

[697.3s - 707.5s] (Chunk 040)
Thank you. We'll check in next week. We'll make an appointment for next week and catch up and see how you're doing with all this. Good job.
