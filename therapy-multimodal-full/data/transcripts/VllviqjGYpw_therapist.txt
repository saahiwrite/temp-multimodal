[14.5s - 15.7s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Sherry. How you doing today?

[17.0s - 24.8s] (Chunk 002)
You? Doing okay? I understand you haven't been feeling too well lately. You've had some symptoms. Can you tell me what's going on?

[37.4s - 37.9s] (Chunk 003)
It's.

[43.9s - 45.6s] (Chunk 004)
Little things are really irritating you?

[46.2s - 48.0s] (Chunk 005)
For last week?

[50.1s - 52.1s] (Chunk 006)
This is the first time this has happened.

[54.2s - 62.2s] (Chunk 007)
Yeah. So tell me about the irritation. What kind of things have been.

[116.4s - 124.7s] (Chunk 008)
Alright, so you're really, you're really irritated and you feel like these irritating events are distracting you.

[126.7s - 130.3s] (Chunk 009)
Do you feel like your thoughts are racing?

[161.0s - 168.1s] (Chunk 010)
Have you found, you mentioned work? Have you found that you're more oriented toward getting goals completed?

[173.3s - 181.6s] (Chunk 011)
No. Do you find yourself talking more or feeling like you should talk more? No, nothing like that.

[187.1s - 191.2s] (Chunk 012)
How's your sleep been? Fine.

[209.6s - 210.7s] (Chunk 013)
So your sleep's been okay?

[214.5s - 220.3s] (Chunk 014)
Have you noticed that you're at all down or, like, have depressed mood or anything like that?

[223.6s - 231.4s] (Chunk 015)
No. Are you still finding activities that were pleasurable to be pleasurable now?

[254.3s - 271.2s] (Chunk 016)
Any changes your appetite? No. How about any feelings of worthlessness? No, nothing like that. You mentioned that you're being distracted easily. That's affecting your concentration.

[275.9s - 282.5s] (Chunk 017)
A little bit. Do you have any thoughts regarding death or dying?

[283.8s - 293.6s] (Chunk 018)
Like that. And this irritable mood has been bothering you at work and you mentioned driving home any other places?

[315.6s - 349.9s] (Chunk 019)
Any drug or alcohol usage recently? Nothing. Have you ever seen or heard things other people can't see her here? No, that's never happened. Okay. I'd like to get you in to see somebody today, if that's okay. We have a counselor that's available that can talk to you some more about this. Would that be all right? So I'll get that arranged. And I want to thank you for answering these questions. This has been helpful.
