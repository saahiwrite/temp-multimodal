[14.2s - 15.4s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Rebecca. How you doing today?

[16.6s - 22.3s] (Chunk 002)
You're okay. I understand recently you had a difficult experience. That's what brought you into the clinic.

[81.5s - 91.9s] (Chunk 003)
It sounds like a scary experience. So your sister's injured by the horse. She's okay. But you've had things like this happen before. But this is different.

[106.2s - 109.4s] (Chunk 004)
Okay, so you're dreaming about the accident.

[134.6s - 139.1s] (Chunk 005)
Yeah. So your work experience has become unpleasant.

[141.0s - 147.6s] (Chunk 006)
So you're more aware of the horses and you're more startled by what they do now?

[150.1s - 151.4s] (Chunk 007)
You notice the change there?

[161.9s - 162.3s] (Chunk 008)
It.

[166.7s - 169.1s] (Chunk 009)
Have you been having difficulty concentrating?

[190.4s - 201.2s] (Chunk 010)
The memories seem to be coming back automatically. You're more aware of your surroundings there as you're working?

[204.0s - 212.7s] (Chunk 011)
Have you had any positive emotions? So you said this happened nine days ago. When did the symptoms start?

[223.7s - 224.0s] (Chunk 012)
I.

[232.3s - 232.9s] (Chunk 013)
The next day?

[233.6s - 239.0s] (Chunk 014)
So from that day, from a day after the accident, have you had any positive emotions?

[244.4s - 245.8s] (Chunk 015)
It's been tough for you since then?

[257.2s - 258.1s] (Chunk 016)
It's happened to you before.

[263.4s - 275.0s] (Chunk 017)
This time has been a bit different. That's upsetting. Have you had your memory of what happened compromised at all? You feel like you're missing pieces of what happened?

[280.8s - 281.7s] (Chunk 018)
You remember pretty well.

[285.8s - 296.0s] (Chunk 019)
Have you had any experiences where you had this sense that your surroundings were altered? Kind of like unreal, anything like that?

[306.9s - 321.9s] (Chunk 020)
Alright, how about any episodes where you feel like you're reliving the accent so not. Not just an intrusive memory, but actually like you're reliving it like you're back in that moment? Anything like that?

[326.2s - 346.3s] (Chunk 021)
Memories. Okay. So I want to try to understand what may be going on. So I'm going to ask you a few questions that may not seem like they match well with what you're talking about, but it's important I check these things out.

[348.0s - 350.5s] (Chunk 022)
Do you have any medical problems?

[353.0s - 372.6s] (Chunk 023)
Have you had any recent use of alcohol or drugs? Nothing like that. Rebecca, I'm gonna get you into Seed of counselor. Okay? I appreciate you spending this time with me and answering these questions and telling me what happened. It was helpful.
