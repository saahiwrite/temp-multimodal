[13.9s - 15.1s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Saja. How are you doing today?

[17.1s - 25.0s] (Chunk 002)
I'm doing okay, thanks for asking. I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothersome to you.

[26.6s - 27.9s] (Chunk 003)
Can you tell me about those?

[47.9s - 54.0s] (Chunk 004)
You lose it every time you have to make a presentation? Yeah. Tell me what is involved with losing it.

[100.1s - 113.9s] (Chunk 005)
So very distressing. So tell me about the. The nature of this meeting that's leading to this anxiety. So you said it was. You had to make a presentation. Tell me about the structure of it.

[141.3s - 142.7s] (Chunk 006)
How long do you have to speak?

[152.6s - 157.2s] (Chunk 007)
And when in the course of like with this meeting occurring, when do you start to feel nervous?

[159.4s - 160.1s] (Chunk 008)
The day before?

[163.0s - 169.3s] (Chunk 009)
So the day before the meeting you start to have similar symptoms? Different symptoms. What are you feeling?

[212.6s - 215.0s] (Chunk 010)
Panicking. As the meeting's starting.

[217.5s - 239.6s] (Chunk 011)
So at the meeting, everybody takes a turn and does this brief presentation and tell me what's happening, as with your feelings. As they're moving around. You said a table or. Yeah, as they're moving around the table and. And coming closer to you.

[266.5s - 267.5s] (Chunk 012)
They're gonna notice you.

[280.1s - 281.1s] (Chunk 013)
Have you run out of the room?

[293.2s - 294.6s] (Chunk 014)
There's too much anxiety.

[302.4s - 308.7s] (Chunk 015)
Yeah. So you would push that door open, they would all be looking at you. They would wonder why you left.

[310.4s - 317.9s] (Chunk 016)
So you just wrote out the meeting somewhere else. And did anybody notice after, you know.

[367.8s - 369.6s] (Chunk 017)
This is. This is frustrating for you.

[371.1s - 377.4s] (Chunk 018)
Have there been times where you've fled the room, and then since then, you haven't?

[419.8s - 426.5s] (Chunk 019)
Something about that intense interaction changed how you were feeling, distracted you? Something like that.

[433.8s - 441.7s] (Chunk 020)
So from from that meeting on, like till now, have you been able to stay in for any other meetings?

[443.1s - 446.0s] (Chunk 021)
So you've had to leave because of the intensity of the symptoms?

[472.5s - 487.9s] (Chunk 022)
Yeah. And you're, you're experiencing symptoms when you avoid that interaction in the room too, right? Because you don't feel good about letting them down.

[529.5s - 546.5s] (Chunk 023)
So with this meeting, really, you're in a situation where if you go and attend the meeting, you're going to end up leaving it because of the anxiety. If you don't attend it, you have these concerns about the performance in your jobs. You're kind of stuck, right?

[549.1s - 554.8s] (Chunk 024)
Any other symptoms that you think may or may not be related to this intense anxiety?

[564.0s - 564.4s] (Chunk 025)
I.

[584.7s - 585.9s] (Chunk 026)
Does that have any effect on.

[598.3s - 600.2s] (Chunk 027)
They're picking up on the alcohol.

[611.8s - 613.5s] (Chunk 028)
Any sadness or anything like that.

[625.9s - 627.2s] (Chunk 029)
You feel really down.

[630.7s - 653.6s] (Chunk 030)
