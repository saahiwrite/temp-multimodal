So I want to change gears a little and talk about your family. Is that okay?

[23.3s - 34.3s] (Chunk 002)
A lot of information there, huh? Yeah. All right, let's start with. Can we start with your parents? And tell me what you feel comfortable. Tell me about them.

So how would you describe the quality of your relationship right now with her?

A bad influence on her? On her. Her.

[234.8s - 236.4s] (Chunk 020)
I mean, what makes you think that.

[245.8s - 255.0s] (Chunk 021)
So it sounds like you have a positive relationship. Kind of admire your older sister. Is that right?

[257.3s - 260.1s] (Chunk 022)
And the relationship with the younger sister is a little.

[267.8s - 270.0s] (Chunk 023)
How often do you communicate with each one?

Any mental health history with either sister?

[330.8s - 340.3s] (Chunk 026)
