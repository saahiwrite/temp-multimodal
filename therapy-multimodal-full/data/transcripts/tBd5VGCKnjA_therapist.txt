[14.7s - 15.7s] (Chunk 001)
Elisa, how you doing today?

[17.9s - 18.6s] (Chunk 002)
Doing well.

[20.2s - 21.1s] (Chunk 003)
What's going on?

[27.9s - 29.7s] (Chunk 004)
So you have family flying in?

[53.5s - 56.3s] (Chunk 005)
So you have to cross four times?

[58.6s - 61.0s] (Chunk 006)
So what kind of feeling is this bringing up for you?

[66.2s - 67.6s] (Chunk 007)
So you're anxious right here with me?

[69.3s - 86.5s] (Chunk 008)
So I want to try to scale this and we talked about this before with cognitive therapy. So let's say that 10 is really the most anxious you ever felt about crossing bridges. And one is no anxiety. Where would you be right now?

[90.6s - 91.0s] (Chunk 009)
Eight.

[91.5s - 92.3s] (Chunk 010)
A lot of anxiety.

[100.8s - 104.7s] (Chunk 011)
And what's it on that day reaches a 10.

[107.0s - 111.8s] (Chunk 012)
All right, so but even now, how far away is the. Until they.

[114.4s - 119.0s] (Chunk 013)
So even now, a week out. This is. Nate. This is really hurting.

[122.3s - 127.2s] (Chunk 014)
So for your job and local travel, you don't really have to cross any.

[131.1s - 131.3s] (Chunk 015)
20.

[139.0s - 139.7s] (Chunk 016)
No bridges?

[145.4s - 146.4s] (Chunk 017)
That worked out well.

[148.3s - 166.8s] (Chunk 018)
But coming up, picking up the family you will be crossing. So let's look at this at each stage. Okay. So I mean, you're clearly anxious now, as you mentioned, but let's go to. Let's try to move forward a week to the day that they'll be flying. What time are they flying in?

[168.8s - 171.9s] (Chunk 019)
In the afternoon. So about what time would you have to leave to.

[177.4s - 177.8s] (Chunk 020)
Really.

[196.6s - 211.6s] (Chunk 021)
All right, so let's go to that day. Let's go to that day and to that afternoon. So you're still at home. And let's say we're about 15 minutes before you have to get in the car. What are you thinking then?

[234.5s - 235.7s] (Chunk 022)
And that's what's going through your mind?

[279.0s - 300.1s] (Chunk 023)
It's a big place, a lot going on. So you're sitting at home and 15 minutes before getting the car and you're thinking, I have to do this. But your reasons are positive, like you save money and protect your parents from having to be there alone. So when does the anxiety come in?

[355.5s - 366.2s] (Chunk 024)
So you're anxious before you leave and you're starting to think about the bridge. At that point, you're already thinking about it. How about when you get in your car, you start driving toward the bridge?

[384.2s - 385.5s] (Chunk 025)
So you know you're going over one side.

[389.1s - 391.9s] (Chunk 026)
So before that, when you can still exit, what's your anxiety level?

[394.9s - 395.3s] (Chunk 027)
Yeah.

[403.9s - 406.4s] (Chunk 028)
It's still high, but it's not maxed out yet.

[410.2s - 411.7s] (Chunk 029)
And how about when you cross through the.

[415.5s - 427.6s] (Chunk 030)
So your specific fear as you start to cross this is the Ben Franklin, the first bridge, right. You can go across, is that your car will go off the bridge.

[430.0s - 435.4s] (Chunk 031)
And when does that. So that's a 10. Anxiety. When does that anxiety start to go away?

[462.4s - 468.3s] (Chunk 032)
All right, so then you cross the second bridge, the Gerard Point Bridge. You go to the airport. Is your anxiety drop any of those points?

[476.7s - 477.4s] (Chunk 033)
It's almost gone.

[479.0s - 482.2s] (Chunk 034)
And when do you start thinking about that you're going to have to cross them again?

[493.9s - 494.7s] (Chunk 035)
Not going very quickly.

[501.2s - 516.9s] (Chunk 036)
All right. So you're doing everything you can to keep your car on the bridge, but you're still feeling anxiety, like you're gonna go off the bridge.

[518.1s - 519.9s] (Chunk 037)
The whole time until you start really descending.

[520.5s - 521.7s] (Chunk 038)
And then you feel like you made it.

[527.0s - 527.7s] (Chunk 039)
Because the air.

[543.8s - 546.5s] (Chunk 040)
So in the lower level, it's not as bad.

[558.0s - 561.7s] (Chunk 041)
Are you aware of any time a car would have gone off the bridge?

[576.6s - 578.1s] (Chunk 042)
Do you think it's a high risk?

[602.6s - 620.9s] (Chunk 043)
So you've done some calculations, Geometry. Right. And you conclude that it's not really likely, but it could. It could fly off the. All right. But either way, your anxiety is maxed out on each bridge.

[622.1s - 627.6s] (Chunk 044)
Now, when you get home, when you get your parents back to. You take them back to your home.

[628.6s - 629.4s] (Chunk 045)
How do you feel then?

[638.9s - 644.4s] (Chunk 046)
All right, so when you arrive home, you're down to one.

[648.5s - 656.1s] (Chunk 047)
All right. So going back to the first stage, like when you're getting ready, you were thinking that you have to go.

[657.2s - 660.5s] (Chunk 048)
And it would save your parents money.

[666.4s - 666.7s] (Chunk 049)
Okay.

[680.5s - 683.3s] (Chunk 050)
How important is there safety to you?

[688.2s - 691.2s] (Chunk 051)
So, I mean, clearly it sounds like you picked them up before.

[693.2s - 699.0s] (Chunk 052)
So picking them up is. It's worth all the anxiety?

[702.2s - 702.9s] (Chunk 053)
It's tough.

[710.7s - 714.1s] (Chunk 054)
It's worth it. But you wish that you could do it without anxiety.

[723.8s - 735.4s] (Chunk 055)
There's no. There's no route without any bridges yet to find. And how long have we had the. The anxiety with driving bridges?

[770.5s - 773.6s] (Chunk 056)
But it developed along the way somewhere, and it's been with you ever since?

[775.7s - 809.5s] (Chunk 057)
So I'd like to do what in cognitive therapy, we call a reframe. And actually, you've kind of already done it, but I want to make it a little clearer. So you suffer the anxiety and you suffer it to protect, mostly to protect your parents. So as you're going over the bridge, you're thinking about the automatic thought. We talked about these before. Right. The thought that kind of pops in your mind is, I'm going to fly off the bridge.

[812.6s - 832.7s] (Chunk 058)
So that seems pretty unlikely. Right. That's not something that maybe, as you talked about geometrically, maybe there's a way that your car could fly the bridge with physics and all, maybe it could happen, but it seems like it would be fairly unlikely.

[834.4s - 877.2s] (Chunk 059)
So you could challenge that. And this isn't the reframe part, but you could challenge that on Mac Thought, which, with a statement and adaptive response, like, it's pretty unlikely anything's going to happen. That might help a bit to keep applying that. The chances are vastly in your favor, considering how many cars cross that bridge and how many fly off the bridge. I don't know if I've ever heard of a car flying off one of those bridges. But the other, you know, the reframe part is that you're doing this. You're willing to take on the bridges and have this anxiety for the betterment of your parents, for their safety.

[880.0s - 900.2s] (Chunk 060)
So in this whole equation of crossing bridges and anxiety, you're really the good guy in this. You're willing to. You're willing to suffer and overcome fear to make sure your parents are safe.

[906.4s - 914.5s] (Chunk 061)
Yeah. I mean, and you've thought about before. Like before you leave, you think I really have to pick them up. But you've never really connected it to.

[919.5s - 920.8s] (Chunk 062)
Well, into being the good guy.

[922.9s - 923.8s] (Chunk 063)
Does that make sense?

[937.1s - 965.0s] (Chunk 064)
Yeah. You've overcome it before to pick them up. And when you pick up a Paganio, you'll overcome it again and you'll suffer. But the difference here is that that reframe. I want you to apply that reframe when you're feeling that anxiety as you get ready to leave and as you drive toward the bridge, that you're really, you know, you're doing what you feel is right for the good of your family.

[967.9s - 997.3s] (Chunk 065)
The automatic thought that's going to come in is you're going to fly off the bridge. That's what the anxiety is about. This fear of. And the reframe. In this case, the reframe adaptive response is, I'm doing this for my family. And the probability is pretty low that I'm sorry, if the bridge, that's a separate thing. But the reframe is I'm the hero of this. I think that's a great. You're the hero of this situation.

[1003.2s - 1019.2s] (Chunk 066)
The whole day just kind of go over that, rather than like something you must do because really you don't have to do it, strictly speaking. Right. I know you feel you have to do it, but you're willing to do it. You're willing to sacrifice and suffer to do it.

[1022.4s - 1045.8s] (Chunk 067)
And I'd rather that be the theme that you're getting is a positive theme that you're willing to do. It has to be done. It's uncomfortable. You'll survive it, but it's uncomfortable. And focus on that kind of reframe, then focusing on the very low probability or the risk that you're going to fly off the bridge. So that's very low risk.

[1049.2s - 1050.4s] (Chunk 068)
Does that Kind of make sense.

[1053.8s - 1080.4s] (Chunk 069)
So it's not so much being forced to do it, being forced into an anxious situation. You're voluntarily being brave. I know it's hard. It's hard for you. You're saying it's a 10 on the anxiety scale. That's the highest score. Right. So it's hard for you. But the way to look at it maybe would be your doing has to be done. You're too fully good. Your family, they need you.

[1088.4s - 1091.3s] (Chunk 070)
Have you ever had any close calls on a bridge or anything?

[1141.5s - 1143.3s] (Chunk 071)
So you've always managed to overcome.

[1145.5s - 1160.9s] (Chunk 072)
And that might be another good automatic thought or adaptive response to. Of that automatic thought is that I've always managed to overcome this, and it hurts, but I've managed to overcome it. Am I kind of taking charge like that and being assertive that might help reduce that automatic thought?

[1163.2s - 1164.7s] (Chunk 073)
Do you think you could try that this time?

[1173.6s - 1179.1s] (Chunk 074)
Yeah. All right, so I'll see you again in two weeks, which will give you.

[1182.0s - 1186.3s] (Chunk 075)
And then we'll see how things went with that and we'll move from there.

[1187.2s - 1188.8s] (Chunk 076)
All right. Thanks, Lisa.
