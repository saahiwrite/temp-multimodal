[13.9s - 15.0s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Sherry. How you doing today?

[16.4s - 17.9s] (Chunk 002)
I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.

[19.9s - 20.8s] (Chunk 003)
So you're doing great?

[22.6s - 29.4s] (Chunk 004)
I know your brother brought you in today, and he had expressed some concerns about your mood. Do you know what that's about?

[140.2s - 158.6s] (Chunk 005)
Alright, so you feel like everything's kind of going your way and you're really excited about the new business idea. I know your brother was a little concerned with how much you've been spending on the business idea. And he mentioned some things about different relationships you've had that are new.

[234.4s - 240.1s] (Chunk 006)
He's worried that you don't. One of the things is that new relationship, they don't know the guy too well.

[249.6s - 253.9s] (Chunk 007)
Alright, so your brother just doesn't in your mind, he just doesn't get it?

[280.6s - 285.0s] (Chunk 008)
All right. Have you noticed through all this any change in sleep patterns?

[305.4s - 307.0s] (Chunk 009)
All right, so you do feel rested.

[307.4s - 315.8s] (Chunk 010)
But you haven't been sleeping as much? No. And you. You clearly seem like you're in a good mood. No. No sadness or anything like that?

[320.9s - 327.0s] (Chunk 011)
You're doing pretty well that way. Have you ever been down or depressed?

[353.3s - 363.5s] (Chunk 012)
You ever feel this way before? Kind of in a really good mood? No. No, Nothing like this. So what do you think brought all this on?

[374.0s - 378.2s] (Chunk 013)
Just kind of realizing that's kind of changed your life for the better.

[381.7s - 387.1s] (Chunk 014)
All right. And you mentioned before that you got in some trouble at work, right?

[387.8s - 389.2s] (Chunk 015)
How bad did that turn out?

[425.5s - 426.7s] (Chunk 016)
You're not too worried about that?

[428.8s - 432.8s] (Chunk 017)
Any medical conditions you know of? How about drug and alcohol use?

[435.1s - 440.1s] (Chunk 018)
Really? Well, are you seeing or hearing anything that other people can't see or hear?

[441.2s - 460.3s] (Chunk 019)
No, nothing like that. All right, Sherry, so I know that you're feeling pretty well, but I would like you to see a counselor. Maybe help you as you contemplate these different things we've been talking about. If you'd be okay with talking to.

[461.9s - 468.8s] (Chunk 020)
You'd be okay with that? I'll get that set up. It'll just take a moment. And I want to thank you for answering my questions. This has been helpful.
