[14.4s - 15.5s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Jason. How you doing today?

[17.0s - 17.8s] (Chunk 002)
You're okay?

[24.9s - 26.1s] (Chunk 003)
Can you tell me what's going on?

[51.5s - 53.5s] (Chunk 004)
Can you tell me about what the voice is saying?

[66.8s - 68.2s] (Chunk 005)
You recognize the voice?

[71.1s - 73.7s] (Chunk 006)
It's not similar to anybody that you've known or talked to?

[85.2s - 86.3s] (Chunk 007)
Can other people hear it?

[123.5s - 124.1s] (Chunk 008)
They didn't hear that.

[125.7s - 126.6s] (Chunk 009)
It was clear to you?

[159.6s - 165.8s] (Chunk 010)
So it's something that you can hear and it doesn't appear other people can hear it at all?

[167.4s - 168.9s] (Chunk 011)
And you're sure there's no other explanation?

[175.1s - 179.7s] (Chunk 012)
So you have those voices. Do you have anything that you're seeing that other people can't see?

[206.2s - 211.2s] (Chunk 013)
Does the appearance of the shadows seem to correspond in any way with the voices?

[250.0s - 253.0s] (Chunk 014)
So this must be pretty stressful for you.

[275.4s - 278.3s] (Chunk 015)
Do you remember when it first started? When that was?

[288.5s - 289.7s] (Chunk 016)
And it never happened before.

[293.4s - 297.6s] (Chunk 017)
How about your mood? From that point till now I've been.

[318.5s - 323.4s] (Chunk 018)
No, not more happy than usual, not more sad than usual, no more anxiety than usual.

[336.9s - 341.1s] (Chunk 019)
You think of anything else that might be causing the.

[353.6s - 362.2s] (Chunk 020)
I'm gonna ask you a few questions, maybe find a connection. Any medical disorders, anything going on medically?

[367.8s - 369.1s] (Chunk 021)
Have you ever been hospitalized?

[373.7s - 376.0s] (Chunk 022)
Any use of drugs or alcohol?

[385.8s - 391.8s] (Chunk 023)
Any unusual stressors that have come up in the last like since the symptoms have appeared?

[475.9s - 477.6s] (Chunk 024)
So that would be very stressful.

[498.0s - 500.3s] (Chunk 025)
No fears about going outside or anything like that?

[523.0s - 532.5s] (Chunk 026)
So are there occasions when you do walk by in the day? Are you saying that there are occasions you walk by in the day? What happens then?

[564.5s - 572.8s] (Chunk 027)
Do you notice any connection between the voices and the shadows to that event, to being stressed?

[576.6s - 577.0s] (Chunk 028)
Yes.

[605.5s - 609.8s] (Chunk 029)
Alright, so you're still, you're still stressed from that, from walking by that corner?

[634.2s - 642.2s] (Chunk 030)
And is there any other time when you have the voices or see the shadows, other than in proximity to passing that corner?

[671.2s - 672.5s] (Chunk 031)
This week's been a tough week.

[677.9s - 685.9s] (Chunk 032)
All right, Jason, I appreciate you taking the time to explain to me what's going on. And if you're okay with that, I'd like to get you in to see a counselor here.

[689.0s - 694.2s] (Chunk 033)
All right, I'll get that set up for you. And again, I appreciate you spending this time with me.
