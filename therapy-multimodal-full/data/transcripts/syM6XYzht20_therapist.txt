[14.7s - 15.9s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Emma. How are you doing today?

[18.3s - 26.0s] (Chunk 002)
I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothering you lately.

[27.4s - 29.0s] (Chunk 003)
Can you, can you tell me about that?

[50.9s - 53.8s] (Chunk 004)
Someone was robbed near where you live?

[58.1s - 58.6s] (Chunk 005)
Okay.

[73.0s - 75.2s] (Chunk 006)
How long does it take you to fall back asleep?

[80.8s - 83.0s] (Chunk 007)
And what are you thinking about during that time?

[99.4s - 104.8s] (Chunk 008)
That sounds scary. And you say a couple hours you stay awake?

[105.1s - 105.7s] (Chunk 009)
It's a while.

[107.3s - 115.2s] (Chunk 010)
So this is troubling for you. Have you ever gotten up and checked the door? No.

[121.7s - 130.7s] (Chunk 011)
All right, so you just keep thinking about it. Does it get worse as that time goes on or does it get better? What happens?

[145.0s - 146.8s] (Chunk 012)
So it kind of keeps cycling through the same.

[148.6s - 154.9s] (Chunk 013)
Do you ever do anything to try to get those thoughts to go away? Like focusing on something else?

[173.3s - 191.7s] (Chunk 014)
Alright, so you have a fear that somebody is going to enter or break into where you live and you're staying up at night thinking about whether the door's been secured. That's been troubling you? Anything else?

[216.7s - 217.8s] (Chunk 015)
What do you think might happen?

[235.1s - 240.4s] (Chunk 016)
So when you leave, you're thinking about. It was a hair straightener.

[240.7s - 245.4s] (Chunk 017)
You're thinking about whether you unplugged it or not or turn it off or not.

[247.4s - 250.4s] (Chunk 018)
And how long those thoughts go on for?

[272.3s - 283.8s] (Chunk 019)
All right, So I remember, with the door. You're saying that you struggle with those thoughts, but you don't get up and check the door. Have you ever come back and checked to see if something was left on?

[294.6s - 298.0s] (Chunk 020)
So you're worried, Anxious?

[301.6s - 302.1s] (Chunk 021)
Afraid?

[307.2s - 311.1s] (Chunk 022)
And how. How often does this happen? Like, the cycle of thoughts?

[316.3s - 317.1s] (Chunk 023)
So every day.

[319.7s - 324.2s] (Chunk 024)
And how long has this been going on for?

[330.4s - 331.7s] (Chunk 025)
This has been going on for a year?

[334.0s - 340.0s] (Chunk 026)
And in that year time frame, has it become any worse?

[345.8s - 347.0s] (Chunk 027)
How did it start out?

[376.7s - 391.5s] (Chunk 028)
As you thought about it. All right. I want to ask you a few other questions. Try to help me figure out what's going on have you ever been diagnosed with any condition, like a mental health condition?

[393.0s - 417.0s] (Chunk 029)
How about a medical condition? No, never. Have you ever used alcohol or any other substances? No. No. And has this been the first time in your life you've experienced these symptoms, like starting a year ago, up till now?

[418.6s - 433.5s] (Chunk 030)
Never anything like this before? No. Emma, I'm going to get you in to see one of our counselors here, okay? I appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been helpful for me to try to understand what's going on.

[434.6s - 435.4s] (Chunk 031)
Thanks, Emma.
