[14.6s - 16.8s] (Chunk 001)
Hi Jasmine, how you doing today? Hi.

[17.5s - 18.2s] (Chunk 002)
You're okay?

[19.3s - 20.3s] (Chunk 003)
What's been going on?

[31.0s - 32.3s] (Chunk 004)
A lot of anger, huh?

[33.0s - 34.3s] (Chunk 005)
Can you give me some examples?

[65.1s - 66.4s] (Chunk 006)
So. Quite a bit of anger.

[91.8s - 98.1s] (Chunk 007)
Alright, so from your perspective it doesn't seem to make sense why you got so angry.

[110.3s - 114.0s] (Chunk 008)
Did anything change around the time that the anger started?

[132.0s - 138.7s] (Chunk 009)
Alright, so you're getting upset, you have some anger. Any other time that you're feeling angry?

[170.8s - 181.8s] (Chunk 010)
All right, so that experience for you, you feel like you're releasing more energy than maybe the other people in the way. More, way more.

[191.9s - 204.5s] (Chunk 011)
Alright, so the, in recent memory your anger has increased but it's still not really clear what's going on that's causing.

[215.8s - 219.3s] (Chunk 012)
You feel busy, like, in your daily life, Like a lot of responsibilities?

[221.5s - 222.7s] (Chunk 013)
What kind of things are you doing.

[235.7s - 239.6s] (Chunk 014)
So do you have a lot of responsibilities in the home?

[243.5s - 244.1s] (Chunk 015)
All of them.

[247.5s - 248.8s] (Chunk 016)
What type of things are you doing?

[278.8s - 279.7s] (Chunk 017)
You're doing everything?

[280.6s - 282.2s] (Chunk 018)
And has it always been this way?

[289.8s - 293.4s] (Chunk 019)
Okay. Were you really just doing everything in the home?

[296.9s - 324.6s] (Chunk 020)
All right, I want to ask you. I want to ask you or mention a few words. Right. And I would like you to, if you're okay with this exercise, tell me the first thing that comes to mind. Like, and you can, when I say a word, you can offer several responses, but try not to invest a lot of thought into the response, but more just what occurs to you.

[326.1s - 327.0s] (Chunk 021)
Does that make sense?

[328.8s - 331.2s] (Chunk 022)
So the first word is home.

[343.6s - 349.8s] (Chunk 023)
Repetition. All right, I'm gonna give you another word. Relationship.

[364.0s - 365.7s] (Chunk 024)
All right, let me offer you another word.

[383.3s - 387.3s] (Chunk 025)
Good. All right. And how about another word here?

[408.1s - 417.0s] (Chunk 026)
So do you see any themes in the words that you provided back?

[427.4s - 434.0s] (Chunk 027)
Controlled and structured. What's the source of that? Control and structure or is there a source of it?

[444.1s - 445.5s] (Chunk 028)
Tell me. Tell me what you're thinking.

[480.4s - 487.3s] (Chunk 029)
Alright, so as you're telling me this and you're explaining kind of that relationship with your fiance, what are you feeling?

[504.1s - 511.0s] (Chunk 030)
Is this similar to the anger that you've been experiencing recently, like at the dry cleaner and other places?

[521.8s - 531.3s] (Chunk 031)
So you're thinking that maybe that relationship or some part of that relationship is what's really causing the anger?

[553.0s - 563.0s] (Chunk 032)
All right, so is this, as you talk about this, do you feel like this is new information that you're kind of realizing something that you didn't realize before?

[598.0s - 604.1s] (Chunk 033)
So you feel this is kind of a big moment in terms of awareness?

[624.0s - 634.3s] (Chunk 034)
Okay, so maybe through this session you. You've developed more insight about what's contributing to the anger.

[646.7s - 661.5s] (Chunk 035)
But this source of anger, this relationship, you recognize this is maybe more causal or more contributing, whereas the other objects of your anger, you weren't really sure?

[670.3s - 697.4s] (Chunk 036)
All right, Jasmine. Well, I feel like we've made some progress here, and I'd like you to, between now and the next session, if you're comfortable with it, kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to the surface, what information's maybe been revealed to you a little bit, and we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue. Does that sound like a good plan?

[702.0s - 706.1s] (Chunk 037)
Well, I appreciate you coming in today, and I'll see you in a week.
