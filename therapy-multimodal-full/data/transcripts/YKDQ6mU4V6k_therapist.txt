[11.6s - 14.6s] (Chunk 001)
Miss Spencer. Hi. Dr. Goldblum. Nice to see you again.

[15.5s - 17.8s] (Chunk 002)
It's. It's been a while since I've seen you.

[18.8s - 20.7s] (Chunk 003)
I think not since your last general checkup.

[22.3s - 26.8s] (Chunk 004)
Okay. Well, it's nice to see you again. But tell me what brings you in?

[32.5s - 33.2s] (Chunk 005)
Try me.

[68.4s - 71.4s] (Chunk 006)
So how long since Josh finished his internship?

[78.0s - 79.4s] (Chunk 007)
And looking back now.

[80.1s - 83.6s] (Chunk 008)
When was the first inkling of worry for you about how he's doing?

[87.0s - 87.4s] (Chunk 009)
He.

[101.9s - 104.7s] (Chunk 010)
And do you have any kind of communication with him?

[121.6s - 125.4s] (Chunk 011)
What's your worst fear about what's going on with Josh?

[139.8s - 140.7s] (Chunk 012)
You can't reach him?

[141.6s - 143.7s] (Chunk 013)
And who's got the best connection with.

[154.6s - 161.1s] (Chunk 014)
Of course, it's hard for me to know exactly what's going on with Josh without having a chance to talk with him myself.

[162.3s - 164.8s] (Chunk 015)
But you're worried that he's depressed.

[168.7s - 172.3s] (Chunk 016)
Are you worried that he's depressed to the point of thinking about killing himself?

[174.8s - 177.3s] (Chunk 017)
But you're worried that he's depressed.

[181.1s - 184.7s] (Chunk 018)
Are you worried that he's depressed to the point of thinking about killing himself?

[196.0s - 196.4s] (Chunk 019)
Yeah.

[196.7s - 200.8s] (Chunk 020)
Do you ever hear him talking out loud when there's no one else there?

[209.2s - 212.8s] (Chunk 021)
When he emerges, though, is. Does he look different?

[214.6s - 215.7s] (Chunk 022)
Has he lost weight?

[217.7s - 231.2s] (Chunk 023)
Okay, so the most important thing is going to be figuring out with you and with your husband together, we need to strategize on how we can get Josh to come in and to talk with me.

[232.2s - 247.5s] (Chunk 024)
And I think that's going to work better if I see you and your husband together and we put our heads together to figure out a solution. Because I understand why you're worried, and it's right to be worried, but we're going to have to figure out a way to connect with Josh.
