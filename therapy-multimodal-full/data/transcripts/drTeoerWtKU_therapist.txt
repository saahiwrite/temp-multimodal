[14.6s - 15.8s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Jackie. How you doing today?

[19.4s - 20.9s] (Chunk 002)
I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.

[21.8s - 26.3s] (Chunk 003)
I understand you've had some recent difficulties and that brought you into our agency.

[35.8s - 36.6s] (Chunk 004)
Relationships?

[40.9s - 41.9s] (Chunk 005)
You have a lot of stuff?

[43.1s - 43.9s] (Chunk 006)
Like where you live?

[73.9s - 81.1s] (Chunk 007)
So there's a lot of stuff in your house and this is affecting your relationship?

[141.8s - 144.6s] (Chunk 008)
But to throw something away?

[157.6s - 163.3s] (Chunk 009)
So you mentioned your house is overflowing. How cluttered? Can you describe it?

[192.1s - 194.9s] (Chunk 010)
What type of things? You mentioned a newspaper.

[226.3s - 232.9s] (Chunk 011)
So you have a lot of stuff in the house, and it's congested, but you're able to move around and live there?

[239.3s - 243.8s] (Chunk 012)
Yeah, but it'd be difficult or it is difficult when other people come by.

[251.3s - 260.7s] (Chunk 013)
Some of these items you said you received when you received the house, do you ever go out and buy things and bring them in?

[279.1s - 280.5s] (Chunk 014)
And how often do you buy things?

[303.1s - 305.3s] (Chunk 015)
Does your vehicle have stuff in it now that you bought?

[322.8s - 341.0s] (Chunk 016)
All right. So you have some things you buy. You have some things that you otherwise obtain that are in the house. They're already there, and you have trouble parting with them. Have you ever tried to throw anything out or give anything away?

[359.6s - 360.1s] (Chunk 017)
Yeah.

[370.8s - 374.7s] (Chunk 018)
So what would you like to gain from counseling?

[381.7s - 382.0s] (Chunk 019)
Much.

[428.4s - 434.2s] (Chunk 020)
So you'd like to be able to throw things out, clear out your.

[441.2s - 442.1s] (Chunk 021)
Start working on it.

[444.4s - 458.1s] (Chunk 022)
All right. I have a couple other questions. Okay. Do you have any medical problems? No. Any history of mental health disorders, drug and alcohol use?

[460.4s - 461.2s] (Chunk 023)
Drink socially?

[461.4s - 463.4s] (Chunk 024)
Nothing else? No. That's it.

[464.1s - 467.5s] (Chunk 025)
All right. And you do okay at work?

[470.6s - 472.4s] (Chunk 026)
Yeah, There are problems there?

[482.2s - 489.0s] (Chunk 027)
Okay, great. All right, Jackie, if you're okay with it, I'll get you in to see a counselor. We'll get that scheduled.

[490.2s - 491.9s] (Chunk 028)
Okay, great. Thanks.
