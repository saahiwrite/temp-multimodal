[14.2s - 15.9s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Jackie. How you doing today? Good.

[16.8s - 17.9s] (Chunk 002)
You? Great. Yeah.

[20.1s - 27.2s] (Chunk 003)
I'm doing okay. Thanks for asking. I see that you signed a release so I could talk to your mother. And I see she took you in here today.

[28.8s - 29.6s] (Chunk 004)
She brought you in?

[29.9s - 31.1s] (Chunk 005)
Can you tell me what's going on?

[36.0s - 36.4s] (Chunk 006)
No?

[41.3s - 42.7s] (Chunk 007)
She doesn't like how you smoke?

[58.2s - 63.0s] (Chunk 008)
Yeah. So you're concerned? Somewhat, but.

[73.2s - 75.6s] (Chunk 009)
And what are you smoking? As you're concerned?

[82.9s - 84.0s] (Chunk 010)
She's upset about that?

[90.1s - 94.0s] (Chunk 011)
Are there any other drugs or alcohol or anything that you consume?

[96.2s - 97.0s] (Chunk 012)
You drink sometimes?

[102.2s - 103.7s] (Chunk 013)
Not something she's concerned with.

[113.4s - 116.6s] (Chunk 014)
Are you concerned with the alcohol or marijuana?

[123.6s - 128.1s] (Chunk 015)
You don't think it's a problem? No. Can I ask you a few questions about it? Yeah.

[129.3s - 129.8s] (Chunk 016)
Okay.

[131.2s - 133.8s] (Chunk 017)
Can you tell me when you first started using it, how that came about?

[164.1s - 165.8s] (Chunk 018)
So it took the anxiety away.

[167.6s - 172.2s] (Chunk 019)
How long did you have the anxiety before the heroin use?

[177.4s - 178.1s] (Chunk 020)
Couple years?

[193.4s - 200.2s] (Chunk 021)
So you started. You started marijuana because a friend offered to you and because you were anxious?

[201.9s - 203.4s] (Chunk 022)
And then. How about from then on?

[223.5s - 225.2s] (Chunk 023)
All right. When was the last time you used?

[228.3s - 228.8s] (Chunk 024)
This morning?

[231.9s - 237.6s] (Chunk 025)
Did anything happen in particular that you think motivated your mother to bring you in today?

[260.3s - 265.2s] (Chunk 026)
So what do you want to happen? What would your goal be?

[277.0s - 286.2s] (Chunk 027)
In order to make her happy. Would you have to stop? Eh.

[304.0s - 307.4s] (Chunk 028)
So she wants you to get a job too?

[312.7s - 315.2s] (Chunk 029)
Would employment involve drug screening?

[319.9s - 320.2s] (Chunk 030)
Some.

[328.3s - 329.7s] (Chunk 031)
You don't have to worry about that right now.

[341.0s - 343.6s] (Chunk 032)
You mind if I ask you a few questions about your marijuana use?

[346.9s - 360.7s] (Chunk 033)
Have you ever tried to cut down? No. No. Have you ever taken in larger amounts than you wanted to or for longer periods?

[377.2s - 384.6s] (Chunk 034)
How much time do you spend obtaining, using, recovering from marijuana?

[389.6s - 390.2s] (Chunk 035)
Yeah.

[393.3s - 394.4s] (Chunk 036)
It's a big part of your life.

[396.9s - 398.6s] (Chunk 037)
Do you have a craving for marijuana?

[404.6s - 408.2s] (Chunk 038)
So has it led to any social problems for you?

[421.5s - 422.1s] (Chunk 039)
Do they?

[424.8s - 429.6s] (Chunk 040)
Has the marijuana use caused you to give up activities that are important to you?

[436.0s - 436.6s] (Chunk 041)
So not really.

[439.3s - 445.1s] (Chunk 042)
Has the marijuana use caused any activity become dangerous?

[447.8s - 451.8s] (Chunk 043)
Like driving while under the influence or anything like that.

[459.3s - 460.1s] (Chunk 044)
That's dangerous.

[467.8s - 471.3s] (Chunk 045)
Everybody does that now. Your mother, she drove you in today.

[474.1s - 477.9s] (Chunk 046)
Was she worried that you were under the influence of marijuana?

[492.0s - 496.4s] (Chunk 047)
Do you have any history of mental health disorders?

[499.3s - 502.0s] (Chunk 048)
Just anxiety? How about medical problems?

[503.0s - 513.1s] (Chunk 049)
No. Do you notice that when you stop using, you have physical symptoms or anxiety?

[518.5s - 520.7s] (Chunk 050)
What's the longest you have stopped? For.

[533.1s - 533.9s] (Chunk 051)
When you sleep.

[537.8s - 541.1s] (Chunk 052)
So it's an everyday activity for you?

[541.9s - 543.2s] (Chunk 053)
And it's been that way for a while?

[547.6s - 556.4s] (Chunk 054)
Couple years, yeah. All right. Jackie, I know that your mom wants you to get counseling here. Are you open to it?

[574.7s - 576.5s] (Chunk 055)
You okay with giving it a try?

[579.3s - 585.3s] (Chunk 056)
All right. I'll get you scheduled to see a Caster, and we'll see where that goes from after your first appointment.

[587.1s - 587.7s] (Chunk 057)
Is that all right?

[589.3s - 593.2s] (Chunk 058)
I want to thank you for telling me what's going on, for answering my questions. It's been helpful.
