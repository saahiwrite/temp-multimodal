[0.2s - 37.5s] (Chunk 001)
Sam. Okay, so you said that when you're at work you really worry that you're going to say something stupid.

[41.9s - 45.5s] (Chunk 002)
What would be so bad about that if you did say something stupid at work?

[49.8s - 53.0s] (Chunk 003)
What would be so bad? If people at work thought you weird.

[57.1s - 60.5s] (Chunk 004)
And what would be so bad about that if people at work didn't want to be friends with you?

[66.0s - 68.5s] (Chunk 005)
Then what would be so bad about having no one to talk to at work?

[78.6s - 82.2s] (Chunk 006)
And what would be so bad about being by yourself, you know, for a whole day?

[89.7s - 95.7s] (Chunk 007)
Oh, that must be tough. What does that mean to you that you spend a lot of time on your own?

[106.8s - 120.5s] (Chunk 008)
So it sounds like deep down that you think that you're not worth being friends with. And that's quite a negative belief. I mean, how much would you say that you believe that out of a hundred? If 100 is where you believe it totally and 0 is where you don't believe it at all.

[126.4s - 128.1s] (Chunk 009)
When did you start believing that?

[135.1s - 139.9s] (Chunk 010)
And what was it about school that made you start to believe that you weren't worth being friends with?

[156.5s - 159.3s] (Chunk 011)
And what is it now that makes you think that that's still true?

[179.1s - 184.8s] (Chunk 012)
That sounds tough. Is there anything that makes you think that it's not true that. That you are worth being friends with?

[195.3s - 244.7s] (Chunk 013)
Okay, so it sounds like deep down you have this thought that you're not worth being friends with. And that started at school, when you had trouble making friends at school, and that you weren't always picked for teams, and that now at work, it feels like the same thing is happening. That you're not always invited out for drinks with people after work, and that sometimes you feel that you're excluded from their social groups, but then that's not the whole story. That, on the other hand, you are close to family and you do have friends who would say that it's not true that you are worth being friends with. In cbt, we do a thing called thought challenging, where when we have these negative thoughts, sometimes we actually put them up to scrutiny. We weigh up the evidence for and against them. I like to think of it as putting the thought on trial. Could we do that now? Where we just actually try and weigh up the evidence for and against that thought a bit more?

[245.6s - 266.5s] (Chunk 014)
Okay. So if I just put two columns here. So for and against. And it sounds like the evidence for this thought that makes you think that it is true is difficulty at school, making friends, being picked for teams, and difficulty at work, feeling excluded, sometimes from groups.

[270.0s - 289.6s] (Chunk 015)
But actually, in this other column, we have that you are close with your family and that you have some close friends. Okay, now moving back to this first column. Is there anything else that makes you think it's true that you're not worth being friends with?

[303.9s - 309.4s] (Chunk 016)
Don't go to parties. What kind of parties are we talking? Like, big parties? Small parties?

[321.9s - 331.7s] (Chunk 017)
Okay, so you don't go to larger parties and events. Okay. Is there anything else that maybe thinks that makes you think that it's not true that actually you are worth being friends with?

[353.9s - 361.7s] (Chunk 018)
Okay, so your friends would say that you are worth being friends with, and it Sounds like you put your friends first.

[365.7s - 367.8s] (Chunk 019)
In what kind of ways do you put your friends first?

[382.3s - 384.9s] (Chunk 020)
Can you give me an example of a time that you've done that?

[394.2s - 396.6s] (Chunk 021)
So you actually helped to organise events for your friends?

[399.8s - 404.2s] (Chunk 022)
Is there anything that you do that you wouldn't do if you weren't a good friend?

[420.7s - 424.4s] (Chunk 023)
So you'll tolerate your anxiety if it means something to a friend of yours?

[428.2s - 474.6s] (Chunk 024)
Okay, so at the moment in the four category we've got that you had difficulty making friends at school, that you're having difficulty now at work making friends, and that you don't go to larger parties or events. But actually there's a lot of evidence in the against column, evidence that would suggest that actually you are worth being friends with and you're a good friend, that you're close with your family, you're close with your friends, your friends would say that you're a good friend, you put your friends first. Even when you're anxious, you tolerate that anxiety if you know it will mean something to them, that when things are important to your friends, like birthdays, you'll make a real effort. You'll even actually go to the effort of organising events and baking cakes and doing things like that for other people. Is there anything else that you do that makes you think that maybe you are a good friend, you are worth being friends with?

[484.9s - 495.4s] (Chunk 025)
Okay, so it sounds like you've got long term friendships as well. So you might have trouble making friends, but when you make them, you stick with them. Yeah. Okay, I'm just going to give you this list now to have a look at.

[504.4s - 506.4s] (Chunk 026)
How do you feel now that you're looking at that list.

[527.7s - 533.0s] (Chunk 027)
So it's not that you're not worth being friends with, but actually that you're choosing not to engage with people always?

[535.0s - 548.7s] (Chunk 028)
Yeah. Okay. And if I was to ask you now, you know this idea that you're not worth being friends with, how much do you believe that now that we've done this exercise where 100 is where you really believe that you're not worth being friends with and zero is that you don't believe it?
