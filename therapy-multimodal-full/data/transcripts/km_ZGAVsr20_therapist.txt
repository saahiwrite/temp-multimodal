[14.5s - 15.0s] (Chunk 001)
Hi Jackie.

[18.9s - 28.1s] (Chunk 002)
I'm doing okay, thanks for asking. I understand you've been having some difficulties that have facilitated you to come into our agency.

[45.6s - 52.6s] (Chunk 003)
Alright. So you feel like you're drinking more than usual? Mm. How much are you drinking now?

[69.2s - 73.8s] (Chunk 004)
Three or four nights a week. And how much are you drinking each time you go out?

[106.3s - 117.0s] (Chunk 005)
Alright, so do you know how much alcohol, like you talk about the time period, do you know how much you're actually drinking each night? Like approximately?

[141.0s - 146.0s] (Chunk 006)
Do you find that you need to drink more to get the desired effect?

[165.7s - 170.2s] (Chunk 007)
Have you made any attempts to cut down on consumption?

[199.4s - 214.6s] (Chunk 008)
So I want to talk about the time you spend using alcohol. Are you okay with the amount of time you mentioned that you're using for a longer period? But are you okay with that or is that something that's distressing you?

[228.3s - 231.4s] (Chunk 009)
Do you find that you have a craving for alcohol?

[260.1s - 263.6s] (Chunk 010)
So you're thinking about it but you're also feeling the craving?

[267.9s - 274.9s] (Chunk 011)
Okay. You mentioned work. Are you having trouble with responsibilities at work or any other area?

[281.7s - 282.7s] (Chunk 012)
Because of the drinking?

[284.5s - 287.0s] (Chunk 013)
How about any social problems due to the alcohol?

[297.6s - 299.0s] (Chunk 014)
Alright, so no social problems?

[300.3s - 304.0s] (Chunk 015)
Have you had to give up any important activities because of the alcohol use?

[321.2s - 331.2s] (Chunk 016)
Nice you haven't missed any important activities because of that. How about engaging in any activities that are physically dangerous because alcohol is involved?

[338.2s - 342.5s] (Chunk 017)
Do you have any medical or mental health history?

[361.3s - 368.9s] (Chunk 018)
It's not been an issue, no. Has any medical problem or mental health problem become worse because of the alcohol?

[380.3s - 383.2s] (Chunk 019)
So you mentioned alcohol use. Has there been any drug use?

[393.8s - 394.9s] (Chunk 020)
So it's just alcohol now?

[398.5s - 405.1s] (Chunk 021)
Do you have. When you stop drinking, do you have any physical symptoms or anxiety, any symptoms of withdrawal?

[414.0s - 415.1s] (Chunk 022)
Okay, so that's not a problem?

[418.7s - 422.3s] (Chunk 023)
Jackie, are you open to receiving counseling services at our agency?

[427.3s - 429.2s] (Chunk 024)
But you'd be okay with child?

[430.7s - 438.4s] (Chunk 025)
All right, I'm going to get you scheduled in to see a counselor. I want to thank you for telling me about what's going on and for answering my questions. It's been helpful.
