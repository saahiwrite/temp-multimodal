[14.0s - 15.1s] (Chunk 001)
Hey Jessica. How you doing today?

[17.0s - 17.9s] (Chunk 002)
You doing okay?

[18.9s - 26.2s] (Chunk 003)
I understand you've been having some recent difficulties that brought you into our agency. Can you tell me about that?

[32.2s - 32.9s] (Chunk 004)
Anxiety?

[51.7s - 55.7s] (Chunk 005)
So you're anxious when you're getting ready to go to work?

[57.0s - 58.9s] (Chunk 006)
Do you know what might be causing that?

[89.4s - 94.3s] (Chunk 007)
Alright, so you, you went out to your car, you saw some damage, it reminded you of an accident?

[125.7s - 129.8s] (Chunk 008)
They said the accident occurred at the end of last year.

[139.8s - 142.7s] (Chunk 009)
So maybe about eight months ago. That sound right?

[146.5s - 152.7s] (Chunk 010)
When did the symptoms start? Being anxious when you're getting ready to go to work?

[161.2s - 164.6s] (Chunk 011)
And you've been having those continuously from then?

[184.0s - 186.2s] (Chunk 012)
Ever been late to work because of the anxiety?

[189.8s - 190.5s] (Chunk 013)
Almost every day?

[191.1s - 194.7s] (Chunk 014)
So this has been, this has been a problem for you in a few different ways?

[201.1s - 209.7s] (Chunk 015)
Have you tried anything to reduce the anxiety, like using another car or anything else?

[271.9s - 279.2s] (Chunk 016)
And you're having kind of physical distress too? Yeah, like you're feeling. You're feeling physical overwhelmed.

[287.0s - 291.2s] (Chunk 017)
You ever have any dreams about the accident or anything related to the accident?

[296.7s - 309.9s] (Chunk 018)
Do you ever have any point when you're not asleep where you feel like you're kind of taken back to the time the accident happened? Like you're reliving it in any way? No, nothing like that?

[314.0s - 316.1s] (Chunk 019)
Do you remember the accident pretty well?

[328.7s - 330.8s] (Chunk 020)
Who do you believe is responsible for the accident?

[344.1s - 355.4s] (Chunk 021)
So from the time that you noticed these anxiety symptoms, have you had periods where you were happy and kind of positive emotional experiences?

[361.7s - 367.8s] (Chunk 022)
The whole time you've been down, have there been moments where you haven't been or has it been consistently down?

[377.0s - 386.5s] (Chunk 023)
Not sure. How about your relationships with other people? Have they changed from when the anxiety started?

[388.6s - 390.0s] (Chunk 024)
You feel detached from people?

[395.2s - 396.6s] (Chunk 025)
To be around, not connecting with people?

[398.0s - 404.5s] (Chunk 026)
Nothing like that. How about any feelings of irritability or anger, outbursts or anything like that?

[409.4s - 414.3s] (Chunk 027)
Do you feel like you've been behaving in a more reckless way at all?

[418.1s - 442.2s] (Chunk 028)
Like taking more chances in relationships or another? Nothing like that you're aware of. Like when something surprises us, we kind of have this startle response, jump. It's natural. Have you noticed that response has changed at all?

[455.4s - 461.6s] (Chunk 029)
And you feel like your response is more than it used to be? More than just the natural star response you had?

[464.1s - 469.2s] (Chunk 030)
That's where I am. Any trouble concentrating?

[472.5s - 474.1s] (Chunk 031)
You been okay concentrating?

[475.2s - 476.5s] (Chunk 032)
Staying focused? Has been.

[480.1s - 485.2s] (Chunk 033)
How about trouble with sleep? Trouble falling asleep? Staying asleep?

[495.3s - 502.7s] (Chunk 034)
All right, so you're getting to sleep okay. You're falling asleep okay. But just having trouble staying asleep?

[505.4s - 507.9s] (Chunk 035)
Are you thinking about anything specific when you wake up?

[524.6s - 526.9s] (Chunk 036)
Any use of drugs or alcohol?

[527.8s - 529.1s] (Chunk 037)
How about medical problems?

[531.5s - 543.1s] (Chunk 038)
Are there ever points from when this anxiety started that you feel kind of outside of your own body? Kind of an unreal feeling where you're separated from your own body?

[548.5s - 558.0s] (Chunk 039)
How about times when you feel disconnected from the environment, like an unreal feeling about what's going on around you?

[566.3s - 572.0s] (Chunk 040)
Hi, Jessica. I'm gonna get you in to see a castle here, if you're open to that. If that's something you want to do.

[573.2s - 578.5s] (Chunk 041)
And I appreciate you taking the time to tell me what's going on and answer these questions. It's been helpful.

[580.4s - 580.8s] (Chunk 042)
Sure.
