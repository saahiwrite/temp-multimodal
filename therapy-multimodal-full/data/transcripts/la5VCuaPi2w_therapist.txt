[14.4s - 15.6s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Jason. How you doing today?

[17.7s - 19.1s] (Chunk 002)
I'm all right. You all right?

[20.3s - 21.1s] (Chunk 003)
You're just here?

[23.1s - 26.2s] (Chunk 004)
I understand that you were in the hospital a couple weeks ago.

[35.9s - 38.2s] (Chunk 005)
Can you tell me about that? Yeah.

[74.4s - 76.1s] (Chunk 006)
What do you think the government's trying to do?

[98.6s - 103.5s] (Chunk 007)
And tell me about your room. What are you doing there that makes that special?

[134.2s - 136.6s] (Chunk 008)
Is that how you were feeling when you were building it?

[154.9s - 156.3s] (Chunk 009)
That's what you're trying to do when you.

[194.5s - 195.4s] (Chunk 010)
They could be happy.

[196.3s - 197.6s] (Chunk 011)
Like you, like you were happy.

[239.2s - 245.4s] (Chunk 012)
So you had a period of time. We had like a lot of energy and you weren't really sleeping much.

[249.3s - 252.0s] (Chunk 013)
You were happy and felt.

[277.0s - 281.3s] (Chunk 014)
And how do you feel now in comparison? I'm all right. You all right?

[295.2s - 297.1s] (Chunk 015)
So not happy. How about sad?

[304.5s - 306.4s] (Chunk 016)
Do you want to get back to that happiness?

[313.9s - 314.6s] (Chunk 017)
The machine?

[315.9s - 321.8s] (Chunk 018)
Now, you mentioned you'd ordered some products online. How much did you order?

[364.7s - 366.6s] (Chunk 019)
He would have been affected by your machine.

[380.0s - 382.8s] (Chunk 020)
Were all those hard drives fairly expensive?

[416.9s - 418.8s] (Chunk 021)
How did your mother respond to that?

[435.8s - 437.4s] (Chunk 022)
Is that a strange relationship?

[442.6s - 443.9s] (Chunk 023)
You get along okay with her?

[465.5s - 468.9s] (Chunk 024)
And you mentioned that they changed your medications in the hospital.

[471.1s - 475.6s] (Chunk 025)
The government? Yes. How are you feeling about taking your medications?

[509.4s - 512.5s] (Chunk 026)
All right. So you really want to get back to working on that machine?

[517.0s - 522.0s] (Chunk 027)
Have you found yourself as motivated these last couple weeks as you were before you were hospitalized?

[536.0s - 537.7s] (Chunk 028)
You still want to get that done? It's important to you?

[543.9s - 550.5s] (Chunk 029)
All right. Jason, I'd like you to continue seeing a counselor here. Have you found the counseling to be helpful?

[553.7s - 555.0s] (Chunk 030)
It's been okay, yeah.

[563.7s - 564.5s] (Chunk 031)
It's been okay?

[565.2s - 573.9s] (Chunk 032)
All right. We'll continue with counseling, and I hope that can help you a bit. And I appreciate you spending this time with me and explaining what happened.
