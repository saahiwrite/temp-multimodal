I agree with you that it is your wish and we will respect that wish, that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again. And then, of course, your second question, which is great as well, is how do we make sure this doesn't happen? So what I'm gonna do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions to ask you, but after a conversation, I write a note documenting what we talked about, that we talked about the breathing tube and your reasons for why you don't want it, which, of course, makes sense to me. And then what I do is I document a short form called Goals of Care. Just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form, and in two seconds, they know exactly what you want. We will give you a copy of that to take home, but I find that's not usually enough. What we also do, what I do is I tend to, when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor and that note's actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta. And in that note, it will very clearly state you and I had this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing, too. So I'll reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that tube. Okay.",
