[14.2s - 15.4s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Lise. How you doing today?

[20.5s - 22.2s] (Chunk 002)
Having some problems. What's going on?

[35.5s - 36.7s] (Chunk 003)
Like adhd?

[37.8s - 39.2s] (Chunk 004)
You think you might have adhd?

[41.0s - 50.0s] (Chunk 005)
All right, so let me ask you some other questions and then we'll get into some questions specifically about that and see what's going on there.

[50.9s - 52.7s] (Chunk 006)
Do you ever find yourself depressed?

[53.7s - 63.8s] (Chunk 007)
Anxious? No. Any trouble with drugs or alcohol? Oh, no, nothing like that. When did you first notice you had the symptoms?

[69.6s - 76.1s] (Chunk 008)
Do you know what age? No. No. All right, but you're thinking early teens, maybe before.

[78.0s - 87.8s] (Chunk 009)
Do the symptoms, are they really bothersome to you? They causing you problems? Yeah. What kind of areas do they cause you problems?

[93.2s - 93.7s] (Chunk 010)
Yeah.

[94.9s - 95.5s] (Chunk 011)
Do you work?

[96.7s - 98.0s] (Chunk 012)
Does it cause problems at work?

[99.9s - 101.5s] (Chunk 013)
How about college?

[103.0s - 104.8s] (Chunk 014)
Okay. How about at home?

[106.1s - 118.2s] (Chunk 015)
Okay. All right, so tell me a little bit about the symptoms that you think might indicate adhd. What's going on?

[141.9s - 145.7s] (Chunk 016)
Alright, so you feel compelled to stand up in class?

[146.9s - 149.3s] (Chunk 017)
Even though, you know, it might draw some attention?

[156.9s - 173.8s] (Chunk 018)
Alright, so I'm gonna ask you a few questions and ask you kind of two categories of questions. Okay, so I'm going to start with the first category. Do you feel like you have trouble establishing attention? Let's look at this in terms of school.

[176.2s - 183.1s] (Chunk 019)
Okay. How about when you have established attention, do you. Do you find yourself struggling to hold on to it?

[183.7s - 191.6s] (Chunk 020)
Yes. And again, I'll just stick with the school environment. Right. That's a place where these symptoms bother you.

[197.6s - 201.6s] (Chunk 021)
That's a big one. Okay. Do you have trouble listening in class?

[202.6s - 208.8s] (Chunk 022)
You do? How about following through on instructions that are provided by, say, the professor?

[213.2s - 215.0s] (Chunk 023)
Do you find yourself organized?

[217.0s - 228.2s] (Chunk 024)
You are pretty organized. Do you find yourself in school or other settings avoiding activities that require a lot of mental effort?

[232.2s - 233.5s] (Chunk 025)
What are some things you avoid?

[246.1s - 256.7s] (Chunk 026)
You ever find yourself losing things that you need to function at work or school? No. No. Distracted?

[258.9s - 265.8s] (Chunk 027)
I do get distracted fairly easily. Yeah. Yeah. How about forgetfulness?

[270.3s - 278.7s] (Chunk 028)
Okay. So I'm going to move and ask you another category of questions. Okay? Okay. Do you find yourself fidgeting?

[283.0s - 289.5s] (Chunk 029)
How do you do with. I think you touched on this before. But how do you do with quiet activities, like, for example, reading?

[293.2s - 294.0s] (Chunk 030)
You struggle with that?

[304.8s - 308.3s] (Chunk 031)
So when you are engaged in quiet activities, do you find yourself kind of wandering off?

[308.7s - 313.5s] (Chunk 032)
You do. Do you ever feel like you have an internal motor that won't shut off?

[316.1s - 321.1s] (Chunk 033)
No. Okay. Do you feel like you talk excessively?

[328.4s - 332.9s] (Chunk 034)
What settings do you find that's a problem at?

[333.9s - 335.2s] (Chunk 035)
That's a big one. Yeah.

[351.5s - 354.9s] (Chunk 036)
Do you ever find that, say, in class, you blurt things out?

[355.7s - 359.6s] (Chunk 037)
Yeah. And interrupt people.

[361.0s - 373.5s] (Chunk 038)
Do that. Okay. Have a situation where, like, say at work or school or at home where you have to wait your turn for something. Do you find that's a problem?

[378.2s - 381.3s] (Chunk 039)
It could be a drive through. If you're a drive through. Do you find.

[385.4s - 389.4s] (Chunk 040)
You don't have any trouble with, like, waiting in lines or waiting for your turn?

[390.8s - 406.0s] (Chunk 041)
Guess not. Okay. Okay. All right. So I'm going to get you in to see one of our counselors. You mentioned that these symptoms are bothersome to you.

[406.4s - 410.6s] (Chunk 042)
And I want to make sure you get treated. It'll take a couple days to get you in to see somebody. Is that okay?

[412.2s - 417.5s] (Chunk 043)
Lisa, I want to thank you for spending this time with me and answering these questions. This has been really helpful.

[418.6s - 419.1s] (Chunk 044)
Thanks.
