[1.1s - 5.4s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Alex. My name is Tony. I'll be your nurse for today. How are you doing?

[10.6s - 11.6s] (Chunk 002)
Oh, what happened?

[14.5s - 16.4s] (Chunk 003)
Can you tell me a little bit more about this bar fight?

[58.3s - 67.7s] (Chunk 004)
Well, from. From what I'm getting here is you were intoxicated at that point in time, and then you had a confrontation with this girl, which led to the bar fight and. Am I missing anything?

[82.0s - 87.8s] (Chunk 005)
Okay, so it seems that you get offended. You feel offended being referred to.

[89.9s - 90.2s] (Chunk 006)
No.

[90.7s - 92.4s] (Chunk 007)
Because it labels you as an alcoholic.

[94.1s - 100.2s] (Chunk 008)
All right, well, we do have some time right now. If it's okay with you, I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about your drinking habits.

[102.6s - 103.9s] (Chunk 009)
What does drinking do for you?

[140.5s - 161.2s] (Chunk 010)
Okay, so to me, it seems that drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends. It's your way to socialize, and it breaks that ice. Right. It helps you socialize. And, you know, I also wanted to say that it's very responsible of you to be drinking and not driving.

[161.7s - 163.2s] (Chunk 011)
Yeah. How has it affected your life?

[207.9s - 208.5s] (Chunk 012)
I see.

[209.8s - 225.6s] (Chunk 013)
So from my understanding, drinking, it helps you socialize with friends. It relaxes you. It's, you know, your way of just, you know, it breaks that ice for you. But on the other hand, it's causing that a lot of arguments with you and your significant other, Henry.

[226.6s - 232.2s] (Chunk 014)
And it's causing a lot that all those arguments are leading to a lot of stress in your relationship at this point in time.

[269.6s - 272.7s] (Chunk 015)
He seems like a very lucky guy to have someone love him that much.

[281.1s - 286.0s] (Chunk 016)
So what I'm getting here right now is that you do want to quit.

[286.8s - 296.0s] (Chunk 017)
Yeah. And it's just probably because this alcohol is leading to the arguments with Henry. And it's causing that stress to your relationship.

[297.0s - 305.4s] (Chunk 018)
I know we spoke about AA earlier, and I know you don't really like the idea of it, but what do you know about eight?

[305.6s - 308.0s] (Chunk 019)
Like, what's your. You want to shed some light on that?

[316.7s - 335.1s] (Chunk 020)
Well, you're right. They're from all different flocks of life, and they share their drinking stories, and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. I know you don't want to join A at this point in time, perhaps, but hypothetically speaking, would you ever consider joining it maybe later on down the road?

[340.4s - 347.8s] (Chunk 021)
Okay. Well, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being like, for sure and 1 being not really sure about it.

[350.2s - 354.7s] (Chunk 022)
What would you say where you are on the scale with joining an AAA group?

[361.8s - 362.2s] (Chunk 023)
Six?

[363.8s - 369.4s] (Chunk 024)
Why would you say a six instead of, say, a three? I mean, you're really adamant about not joining A. Really?

[393.8s - 395.4s] (Chunk 025)
Very lucky man. Like I said.

[397.9s - 406.3s] (Chunk 026)
Yeah. So right now we're sitting at a six. What needs to happen to say maybe we can jump that to an 8 or a 9.

[442.2s - 463.5s] (Chunk 027)
Yeah, all of these are, like, very understandable. I mean, it's just. Of course, you want some. An AA meeting to be close to you so you don't have to commute so far. And we all have very busy schedules, so something that fits within our busy schedule definitely makes sense. And of course, the environment, I mean, if you're not happy, they're just. Even a learning environment, if you're not comfortable there, then it's very hard for you to.

[464.0s - 465.6s] (Chunk 028)
You know, to be in that environment.

[468.4s - 476.8s] (Chunk 029)
Well, actually today I was wondering if it's okay with you, I can give you this brochure. It's just for an AA meeting, really close to your location, where you live.

[477.3s - 493.6s] (Chunk 030)
And my number is also on there. Okay. You can always give me a call if you have any concerns. And also, I just want to thank you today for sharing your experience with drinking. And I know it's not, you know, easy to just. This is a very sensitive subject.

[494.6s - 495.9s] (Chunk 031)
So, you know, I want to thank you.

[504.5s - 505.1s] (Chunk 032)
You're very welcome.

[506.2s - 513.6s] (Chunk 033)
You're very welcome. And if it's okay with you, perhaps maybe we can schedule another follow up meeting, say about like two weeks or so?

[514.4s - 515.1s] (Chunk 034)
Yeah, that's okay.

[516.7s - 517.6s] (Chunk 035)
We'll go on from there.

[518.2s - 518.6s] (Chunk 036)
Yeah.
