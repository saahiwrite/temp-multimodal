[14.7s - 15.9s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Shree. How you doing today?

[17.8s - 18.6s] (Chunk 002)
You've been better?

[19.6s - 22.6s] (Chunk 003)
I understand you haven't been feeling so well lately.

[24.0s - 25.0s] (Chunk 004)
Can you tell me about that?

[28.6s - 30.7s] (Chunk 005)
Been depressed or.

[61.7s - 66.6s] (Chunk 006)
Tired all the time. You find you have low energy?

[72.7s - 75.0s] (Chunk 007)
And you say this has been going on for a couple months?

[81.9s - 87.4s] (Chunk 008)
Did anything major happen that you think might have brought this home in? Well.

[103.3s - 104.2s] (Chunk 009)
Sorry to hear that.

[123.4s - 127.5s] (Chunk 010)
Last two months, the symptoms have been more severe or less severe?

[128.1s - 140.2s] (Chunk 011)
More severe. So your cat passed away six months ago? Yeah. And these symptoms you've had for the last two months?

[143.8s - 145.7s] (Chunk 012)
So you're not sure if they're really related?

[155.0s - 159.5s] (Chunk 013)
Do you think about your cat most days? No.

[184.3s - 199.8s] (Chunk 014)
I'm gonna ask you some other questions related to depression, if that's okay. Ye. Have you noticed any change in your interest in seeking fun or pleasure? Like how you approach pleasurable activities?

[218.4s - 221.2s] (Chunk 015)
What types of things do you still try to do?

[244.0s - 244.8s] (Chunk 016)
You still try?

[248.0s - 257.6s] (Chunk 017)
You ever feel restless or kind of the opposite of that. Like, slowed down. Like, you can't move as fast as.

[284.8s - 286.3s] (Chunk 018)
So feel slowed down?

[287.3s - 292.9s] (Chunk 019)
Yeah. Any feelings of worthlessness.

[297.3s - 300.4s] (Chunk 020)
Yeah, you tell me about that.

[320.2s - 323.7s] (Chunk 021)
How about your ability to concentrate? Any changes there over the last two months?

[344.3s - 347.3s] (Chunk 022)
Do you have any thoughts related to death or dying?

[353.9s - 359.1s] (Chunk 023)
Any drug or alcohol use? No. No Medical conditions?

[361.1s - 367.1s] (Chunk 024)
None. Do you ever see or hear things other people can't see or hear?

[372.1s - 375.1s] (Chunk 025)
Not recently. How about before that?

[400.0s - 407.6s] (Chunk 026)
This is years ago you were hospitalized. Did they tell you anything about that hospitalization, like, exactly Why?

[410.1s - 418.4s] (Chunk 027)
I remember it. Did you feel depressed back then like you do now?

[427.0s - 435.9s] (Chunk 028)
Some of the same things. That sounds like it's not clear in your memory what happened.

[440.4s - 453.3s] (Chunk 029)
Have you ever had a period of time where you're too happy, where you had, like, a lot of energy and just couldn't stop moving? Nothing like that?

[454.1s - 477.2s] (Chunk 030)
No. All right, Sher, I'm going to get you in to see a counselor, okay? It'll just take you a couple of days for us to get you in to see somebody, and it's my hope that they can help you. I want to thank you for answering these questions. This has been helpful.
