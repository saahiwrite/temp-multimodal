[0.2s - 0.5s] (Chunk 001)
Sa.

[40.2s - 65.2s] (Chunk 002)
Yeah. This week has been a little bit difficult. I found it really hard to sleep the last few nights. So I think it's because a few nights ago I had, like, a really bad nightmare where I, like, envisioned the lorry, like, coming towards me, and then now I avoid sleep because I don't want to be back in that state of panic. Right.

[69.5s - 69.9s] (Chunk 003)
Yeah.

[73.9s - 95.3s] (Chunk 004)
Like, I was really hot and I was, like, all bothered, and I just didn't want to go back to sleep. I think also because I've been having quite a lot of daydreams where I'm back at the event. It feels like I'm back there, and I'm trapped and it's happening again. So, yeah, it's been quite tough this week.

[108.8s - 109.4s] (Chunk 005)
Yeah.

[118.8s - 120.9s] (Chunk 006)
I think I've heard of it, but I don't know much about it.

[140.4s - 141.4s] (Chunk 007)
Yeah, definitely.

[144.4s - 166.1s] (Chunk 008)
It tends to happen at night when I'm asleep. I might have a nightmare, and that might, you know, bring me back to kind of being trapped in the car and being, like, in a state of panic. But sometimes it happens when I'm at work and I'm not doing that much and my mind starts to work wander a bit.

[232.8s - 235.3s] (Chunk 009)
That, of like time going by. Really?

[239.4s - 250.0s] (Chunk 010)
I suppose, like if you're watching a film and like you don't realize the time passing or if you're like having a really good day and it's like five o' clock and.

[352.1s - 366.8s] (Chunk 011)
Yeah, I didn't realize that it existed, you know, in the autopilot example that you gave so before trauma. So that's interesting to see it, you know, visually there.

[372.5s - 372.8s] (Chunk 012)
Really.

[387.0s - 387.5s] (Chunk 013)
Yeah.

[420.3s - 420.9s] (Chunk 014)
Okay.

[476.9s - 477.4s] (Chunk 015)
Okay.

[482.1s - 483.1s] (Chunk 016)
Maybe touch.

[489.6s - 492.1s] (Chunk 017)
In my bed. Yeah, in my bedroom.

[493.3s - 493.8s] (Chunk 018)
Yeah.

[500.1s - 512.9s] (Chunk 019)
Yeah, I have a throw on my bed, which is really soft. So maybe that could be a good thing to touch to remind me that I'm in a safe place in my bedroom.

[521.3s - 521.6s] (Chunk 020)
Yeah.

[528.5s - 534.8s] (Chunk 021)
I could, like, keep something next to my bed that I like. A mint or something. Yeah, yeah.

[544.3s - 554.5s] (Chunk 022)
I suppose my room smells a bit like perfume or like if I've lit a candle, it's kind of got a homely smell about it.

[600.8s - 601.4s] (Chunk 023)
Okay, cool.

[609.4s - 620.6s] (Chunk 024)
Maybe I have, like, some photos in my room which might remind me of, like, you know, loved ones or, you know, fun things that I've done.

[625.5s - 634.3s] (Chunk 025)
It's usually quite quiet in my bedroom, except for maybe like, my partner's snoring or, like, breathing.

[673.5s - 704.5s] (Chunk 026)
Well, at night it would be really useful because a lot of those things are to do with my bedroom. But also, I suppose if I was at work and I was having a daydream, then I could just have some. Or if I was in the car with my partner and I was getting in a panic, I could just have some mints nearby, maybe that would give me, like, a strong taste of something that I didn't have when I was in the car and, you know, and the lorry was coming towards me.

[757.0s - 770.6s] (Chunk 027)
Yeah, I think it could be useful. I'm willing to, you know, obviously try whatever I can with the photos. Could I use photos on my phone, like, if obviously I'm not in my room?

[785.3s - 786.1s] (Chunk 028)
Okay, great.
