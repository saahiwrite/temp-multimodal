[14.8s - 16.0s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Sarah. How you doing today?

[20.2s - 21.3s] (Chunk 002)
You're hanging in there?

[22.0s - 26.6s] (Chunk 003)
I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothering you. Can you tell me about those?

[62.5s - 70.9s] (Chunk 004)
So a lot of. Lot of worrying. And how many days would you say you worry in a typical week?

[94.6s - 96.0s] (Chunk 005)
It's very distressing for you.

[97.7s - 100.8s] (Chunk 006)
And you mentioned it's impacting school.

[132.3s - 135.2s] (Chunk 007)
So both at school and at home?

[136.7s - 139.7s] (Chunk 008)
You find it difficult to control the anxiety?

[143.0s - 144.7s] (Chunk 009)
That'S affecting in a major way.

[147.1s - 155.8s] (Chunk 010)
I'm going to ask you some other questions that may be tied in with this. Okay. Do you use any alcohol or drugs?

[157.7s - 158.1s] (Chunk 011)
Some.

[169.0s - 170.8s] (Chunk 012)
Control, but it's under control.

[171.8s - 173.7s] (Chunk 013)
How often would you say you drink?

[177.9s - 180.8s] (Chunk 014)
Yeah. And how much would you say you drink?

[187.8s - 190.1s] (Chunk 015)
Okay, how about the drug?

[196.3s - 197.3s] (Chunk 016)
So just now and then.

[200.8s - 208.0s] (Chunk 017)
A couple times a week. All right. Have you ever had a panic attack?

[209.2s - 216.0s] (Chunk 018)
No. Have you ever had any trauma in your history?

[241.5s - 247.3s] (Chunk 019)
So she's. She's been on your mind and when you think about her, what's the feeling that comes up?

[262.2s - 266.7s] (Chunk 020)
All right, so when you're thinking about her, you're having some worry.

[270.4s - 271.8s] (Chunk 021)
That's been distressing you?

[275.4s - 287.6s] (Chunk 022)
All right, so I'm going to ask you some different symptoms and let me know if you've had these symptoms as part of what's going on now. Okay. Do you feel restless, keyed up or on edge?

[292.3s - 297.2s] (Chunk 023)
All right, how about. Do you feel like you get tired easily?

[299.4s - 300.0s] (Chunk 024)
All the time?

[303.7s - 308.2s] (Chunk 025)
How about. Do you find your mind going blank or having trouble concentrating?

[317.6s - 325.7s] (Chunk 026)
Trouble concentrating. Have you noticed that your more irritable?

[330.5s - 331.9s] (Chunk 027)
Cranky. So maybe a little bit.

[334.8s - 341.0s] (Chunk 028)
Okay. Now you mentioned you're tense all the time. Is that like a muscle tension?

[351.4s - 354.4s] (Chunk 029)
Okay. And tell me about your sleep.

[366.8s - 371.5s] (Chunk 030)
So you have difficulty falling asleep. How about once you fall asleep, do you stay asleep?

[397.0s - 399.6s] (Chunk 031)
So sleep has been a big, big problem for you.

[402.4s - 408.1s] (Chunk 032)
Sarah, I'd like to get you in to see a counselor. I can probably get you in to see one in just a couple days, if that's okay.

[410.0s - 410.8s] (Chunk 033)
Would that be helpful?

[411.7s - 416.3s] (Chunk 034)
