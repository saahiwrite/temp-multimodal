[14.2s - 15.4s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Sherry. How you doing today?

[17.4s - 31.5s] (Chunk 002)
I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So you're doing great. I noticed today your brother brought you in and he had some concerns about how your mood has been.

[68.1s - 80.0s] (Chunk 003)
Alright, so you're feeling. You're feeling pretty good and you have been for about a week. Yeah. All right. Have you. Do you feel like your sleep habits have changed?

[112.0s - 117.7s] (Chunk 004)
Alright, so you're sleeping less, but you don't feel tired at all? You feel okay?

[119.7s - 125.2s] (Chunk 005)
Do you find yourself more easily distracted by anything, things around you?

[126.1s - 132.3s] (Chunk 006)
No, Nothing like that. You mentioned you get a lot of things done at work. How about at home?

[160.0s - 171.8s] (Chunk 007)
So you're accomplishing. You're accomplishing a lot now. When your brother brought you in, he had mentioned some shopping and that's one of the things he was concerned about.

[237.7s - 239.9s] (Chunk 008)
You remember how much you spent?

[259.0s - 263.7s] (Chunk 009)
Do you feel like you spent more than you usually would spend on a trip to the mall?

[281.2s - 286.1s] (Chunk 010)
Alright. Have you ever had a time in the past when you felt this way, where you felt really good?

[294.9s - 300.6s] (Chunk 011)
Life's falling into place. So you're feeling pretty good. You feel like things are going your way?

[301.4s - 309.2s] (Chunk 012)
You're getting a lot accomplished. Any sadness or anything like that recently?

[310.0s - 330.0s] (Chunk 013)
No. Any change in appetite? You seem to have a good amount of energy. Any feelings of worthlessness? No, nothing. Any thoughts of death or dying? No. Drug and alcohol use?

[331.4s - 332.7s] (Chunk 014)
How about medical conditions?

[333.6s - 340.1s] (Chunk 015)
None. Have you ever had a time in the past when you felt depressed?

[343.4s - 343.9s] (Chunk 016)
Yeah.

[359.3s - 360.2s] (Chunk 017)
It's a new you.

[361.0s - 369.0s] (Chunk 018)
So do you know what happened with the depression in the past? Like, did you end up in the hospital or being treated in some other way?

[372.6s - 373.7s] (Chunk 019)
There's just no treatment.

[384.5s - 386.0s] (Chunk 020)
But you believe you were depressed?

[388.6s - 398.3s] (Chunk 021)
Now or back then, did you see or hear things that other people couldn't see or hear? No, not now or back then.

[402.4s - 420.6s] (Chunk 022)
All right, Sherry, answering these questions has been helpful to me. I appreciate it. I'm gonna get you over to see a counselor in just a few moments, okay? I know that you're feeling pretty good, but I'd like them to talk to you for just a bit, okay? Is that okay?

[421.0s - 422.3s] (Chunk 023)
All right. Thanks, Sherry.
