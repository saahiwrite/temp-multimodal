[14.4s - 15.6s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Sasha. How are you doing today?

[17.8s - 27.3s] (Chunk 002)
I'm doing okay. Thank you for asking. I understand that you've been having some difficulty with some symptoms. Is that right?

[28.2s - 29.9s] (Chunk 003)
Can you tell me about what's been going on?

[56.5s - 66.6s] (Chunk 004)
Start getting really nervous. So you have a morning meeting at work, and so does each person at the meeting present in a row?

[68.3s - 77.9s] (Chunk 005)
We all take turns. And when you start to feel nervous, when it's your time to talk, or before or after that.

[95.8s - 97.8s] (Chunk 006)
So there's around 10 people at the meeting.

[99.0s - 110.9s] (Chunk 007)
And as luck would have it, you tend to be toward the end. So can you describe what's happening, say, from the beginning of the meeting in terms of what you're experiencing?

[158.6s - 167.9s] (Chunk 008)
On the physical sensation, being nervous, and the. The mental sensation. You're not really hearing what they're saying.

[170.3s - 177.9s] (Chunk 009)
All right, so go on. So you have these physical symptoms, this nervousness. What happens then?

[219.8s - 231.3s] (Chunk 010)
Alright, so. So in the moment when you're, when it's your turn to present, you're still feeling that same nervousness? Like that doesn't, that doesn't go away at all.

[232.4s - 237.4s] (Chunk 011)
And you're trying to hold your body kind of still, like almost like keep control.

[239.4s - 249.0s] (Chunk 012)
And then your voice is kind of sounds like crackly or breaking up as you're trying to read from like bullet points, like on a. Like an outline.

[250.7s - 255.2s] (Chunk 013)
What happens when you have read the last point?

[290.1s - 327.1s] (Chunk 014)
All right, so then the nervousness, that stronger feeling of nervousness that goes away, it's replaced by a more general feeling of nervousness about how your boss will think of you because of the presentation quality. Because as you're presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling, he's picking up on that. And you're aware of that. How long have you noticed these symptoms that appear in this way?

[370.6s - 398.0s] (Chunk 015)
The last few weeks is when you noticed it. So you had some nervousness before presenting in college, but you just kind of thought of it as normal. Didn't really impair your ability to present, didn't affect your grades or anything. Right. Do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to what's going on?

[429.3s - 438.1s] (Chunk 016)
So whatever you have going on, you think that maybe she has that going on too? Maybe the same set of symptoms, at least?

[457.5s - 461.2s] (Chunk 017)
All right. Any feelings of sadness or anything like that?

[481.7s - 486.0s] (Chunk 018)
Do you have any substance use going on? Alcohol, anything else?

[492.4s - 504.6s] (Chunk 019)
And these. I know this is something recent for you, but in these meetings so far, has the nervousness ever caused you to leave the room before they came around to your turn?

[543.2s - 552.6s] (Chunk 020)
Are you ever worried about what they're thinking about? You mentioned what your boss could be thinking about you. Have you ever worried about what the other workers at the table are thinking about?

[588.3s - 595.7s] (Chunk 021)
Have you ever felt. You mentioned you're nervous at the beginning of the meeting. Have you ever felt nervous? Well, in advance of the meeting?

[617.3s - 641.2s] (Chunk 022)
Alright, so you have, you have this nervousness. It's fairly intense, pretty much. Only at these meetings it's been bothering you for a few weeks, Something new, something a little frightening for you. We'll get you set up with treatment. I'll get you in to see somebody in the next few days if that works for you.

[642.1s - 644.7s] (Chunk 023)
And I appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been helpful.

[645.7s - 646.6s] (Chunk 024)
Thanks, Sasha.
