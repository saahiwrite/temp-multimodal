[14.0s - 25.0s] (Chunk 001)
I'm gonna shift gears again a little bit, and I want to talk about your educational history. So can you tell me about your schooling?

[38.4s - 39.1s] (Chunk 002)
Good student?

[58.5s - 65.2s] (Chunk 003)
All right, so you got through elementary school, middle school, high school, school, and now you're in college?

[65.6s - 66.3s] (Chunk 004)
How's that going?

[100.9s - 106.3s] (Chunk 005)
What do you say when they confront you about the performance problems?

[120.8s - 134.6s] (Chunk 006)
Is performing better in school one of your goals? Yeah, we'll keep that in mind. I want to talk now again. I'm going to switch gears a little bit to vocational history, like the history of working.

[136.8s - 137.8s] (Chunk 007)
Have you worked before?

[158.8s - 164.1s] (Chunk 008)
Okay, and how do you felt that you've done with employment?

[171.2s - 176.5s] (Chunk 009)
Has the anxiety or the alcohol use had any effect in that area?

[197.6s - 198.2s] (Chunk 010)
Get hurt or.

[209.6s - 213.7s] (Chunk 011)
Have you ever lost employment because of the anxiety or the alcohol use?

[220.4s - 224.7s] (Chunk 012)
So it's affected you in and in your work a bit.

[226.1s - 227.2s] (Chunk 013)
Does that concern you?

[234.3s - 237.6s] (Chunk 014)
Is that another goal would be to address the.

[238.7s - 243.4s] (Chunk 015)
Employment performance. Okay. What are you in college for?

[246.3s - 248.0s] (Chunk 016)
What do you want to do when you graduate?

[259.5s - 286.4s] (Chunk 017)
Okay. All right. So I'm gonna switch gears again a little bit here. Okay. I move to some other areas. We've talked about the alcohol use, and that's something that you would like to work on. The focus of treatment.

[288.3s - 324.8s] (Chunk 018)
And then the anxiety. Yeah. And you consider in terms of the alcohol use, your goal there would be to use less or to discontinue. Use less. Use less. And you mentioned to me earlier the age where you started drinking. Was it 14? 14. How is the drink? How did you progress from when you started using 14 to present day?

[353.3s - 354.3s] (Chunk 019)
It's more frequent now?

[357.9s - 359.9s] (Chunk 020)
Does drinking reduce the anxiety?

[367.5s - 370.3s] (Chunk 021)
Have you tried before going out and not drinking?

[372.1s - 372.9s] (Chunk 022)
What happens?

[391.3s - 392.8s] (Chunk 023)
And there's times when you do drink.

[402.6s - 404.1s] (Chunk 024)
So it's a better experience for you.

[405.4s - 410.3s] (Chunk 025)
But as we discussed earlier, in the long run, that's not working out so well.

[411.4s - 428.3s] (Chunk 026)
All right. All right. So before I get into the next section, I want to remind you again, any of the questions you don't want to answer or if you'd rather talk about later on or not at all, just let me know that.

[429.1s - 444.2s] (Chunk 027)
All right. Because I'm getting some areas that are a little more sensitive than some of the other areas we discussed to know. So in this next section, I want to talk about your sexual history. Is that okay?

[445.2s - 449.6s] (Chunk 028)
Can you tell me at what age you first had consensual sex?

[450.4s - 457.2s] (Chunk 029)
14. All right, how about non consensual?

[460.2s - 460.6s] (Chunk 030)
Never?

[468.0s - 474.3s] (Chunk 031)
In terms of legal history, have you ever had any involvement with law enforcement, criminal justice system?

[476.7s - 478.0s] (Chunk 032)
You feel comfortable talking?

[492.5s - 493.3s] (Chunk 033)
What happened?

[510.6s - 512.4s] (Chunk 034)
All right, that was when you were 14, I think.

[515.0s - 519.1s] (Chunk 035)
Around that time. All right. Any other legal issues?

[521.3s - 523.2s] (Chunk 036)
That's the main one, yeah.

[524.3s - 530.5s] (Chunk 037)
That's the only one, yeah. All right. Were you left with any type of criminal record?

[535.0s - 540.7s] (Chunk 038)
Okay. Does your legal history ever come back to interfere with employment or anything? Now.

[544.0s - 554.6s] (Chunk 039)
That's a bar. All right. Okay. Do you have any history of military or government service?

[555.8s - 565.4s] (Chunk 040)
All right, how about your spiritual beliefs? Do you have any spiritual beliefs?

[567.7s - 570.9s] (Chunk 041)
Believe in God? Yeah. Any specific religion?

[572.5s - 577.3s] (Chunk 042)
Catholic. Would you say you're practicing Catholic?

[585.0s - 586.0s] (Chunk 043)
You go when you need to?

[587.6s - 593.0s] (Chunk 044)
How important is Catholicism in your life? Is there spirituality in your life?

[598.2s - 599.6s] (Chunk 045)
But it's there. It's there.

[602.9s - 622.6s] (Chunk 046)
Has your belief system changed throughout your life? No. No. Alright, how about while I'm thinking of it, how about your family? Any spiritual beliefs in your family?

[623.8s - 626.9s] (Chunk 047)
Yeah. Your mother, your father, sister?

[627.9s - 628.5s] (Chunk 048)
Everybody.

[633.7s - 637.1s] (Chunk 049)
Yeah. Has that been an influence on.

[648.9s - 655.8s] (Chunk 050)
Is there anything in your spiritual belief system that you feel like you could draw upon as a strength during treatment?

[658.8s - 673.5s] (Chunk 051)
Yeah. Okay, so I want to ask you about your financial situation. So I'm shifting gears again.

[675.0s - 677.4s] (Chunk 052)
You mentioned you're not working right now.

[677.8s - 678.2s] (Chunk 053)
Correct.

[678.9s - 680.5s] (Chunk 054)
How do you support yourself now?

Once a week?

[708.1s - 710.5s] (Chunk 058)
Do you like that financial arrangement?

[714.7s - 718.0s] (Chunk 059)
It works, yeah. What would be more ideal for you?

[726.4s - 745.9s] (Chunk 060)
They made that clear to you? Yeah. And that's a goal of yours as well? Yeah. Okay. All right. All right, again, I want to switch gears. I want to talk about your sleeping habits.

[746.6s - 752.7s] (Chunk 061)
All right. Do you feel like you get more sleep than you should? Less or the correct amount?

[754.7s - 758.7s] (Chunk 062)
More, on average. How many hours do you sleep at night?

[762.2s - 763.5s] (Chunk 063)
What would you like to sleep?

[767.4s - 768.6s] (Chunk 064)
How long has this been going on?

[774.1s - 779.7s] (Chunk 065)
About three years, yeah. Do you know why you sleep more than you want to?

[795.1s - 798.6s] (Chunk 066)
Do you ever find yourself down, make your mood down?

[799.6s - 800.1s] (Chunk 067)
Sometimes.

[803.7s - 804.9s] (Chunk 068)
When the anxiety's bad?

[808.4s - 809.8s] (Chunk 069)
When was the last time you felt down?

[813.6s - 814.3s] (Chunk 070)
How long ago?

[814.8s - 818.3s] (Chunk 071)
Two weeks. And how down were you?

[824.9s - 826.3s] (Chunk 072)
What does depressed look like?

[838.0s - 840.4s] (Chunk 073)
But you indicated you weren't depressed, right?

[841.7s - 845.2s] (Chunk 074)
So that's what you were doing?

[862.7s - 869.7s] (Chunk 075)
All right, so a bit down, but in your opinion, not depressed?

[873.3s - 875.5s] (Chunk 076)
Did it change anything in terms of your drinking?

[881.7s - 883.2s] (Chunk 077)
Is that what happened this last time?

[887.5s - 898.3s] (Chunk 078)
Okay, I'm gonna shift gears again. I want to ask you about your E habits. Do you feel like you eat in a healthy manner? Yeah.
