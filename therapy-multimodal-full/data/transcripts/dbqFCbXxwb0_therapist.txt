Hi, Jackie. How you doing today?

[17.4s - 18.2s] (Chunk 002)
You all right?

[20.9s - 25.6s] (Chunk 003)
Having a rough time. I understand there have been some difficulties lately that brought you into the agency.

[26.1s - 27.0s] (Chunk 004)
Tell me what's going on.

[81.5s - 93.8s] (Chunk 005)
And what did you notice right away? So one of the boxers was. Sounds like knocked out. You saw that? What did you notice right away? What was happening?

[120.4s - 124.6s] (Chunk 006)
Alright, so you left and the symptoms, they continued?

[146.0s - 147.0s] (Chunk 007)
What kind of problems?

[171.3s - 181.4s] (Chunk 008)
All right. Do you find that you're having memories of the incident at the boxing match that are kind of intrusive?

[184.9s - 186.3s] (Chunk 009)
And it's bothersome for you?

[195.6s - 203.6s] (Chunk 010)
And you try, but yeah, the memories stay there. Any dreams related to the.

[205.9s - 206.3s] (Chunk 011)
No.

[210.8s - 216.0s] (Chunk 012)
Any times when you feel like you're reliving what you saw, like you're seeing it again?

[220.8s - 232.7s] (Chunk 013)
You think about it? Mm. Is anything reminding you of the boxing match and then that's causing you to have symptoms?

[268.3s - 272.4s] (Chunk 014)
Do you find yourself working to avoid, like, music that was similar?

[288.8s - 292.9s] (Chunk 015)
Do you find that you've had any trouble remembering what happened?

[298.6s - 299.8s] (Chunk 016)
It's pretty clear to you?

[303.6s - 306.4s] (Chunk 017)
Have you been irritable at all since the.

[334.4s - 342.5s] (Chunk 018)
How about your awareness level of what's around you? Do you find that your awareness level has increased, that you're. You're more aware?

[395.3s - 398.9s] (Chunk 019)
So you feel like your reaction to that was stronger than it normally would have been.

[402.9s - 405.8s] (Chunk 020)
Have you used drugs or alcohol recently?

[406.7s - 418.5s] (Chunk 021)
No. Any medical problems? No. So, Jackie, I'm going to get you in to see a counselor here at the agency, if that's something that you're okay with.

[420.4s - 428.2s] (Chunk 022)
All right. Just take a couple days to get you on the. To get you in to see somebody to get you on the schedule and get you in to see somebody, and I'll get that arranged.

[429.4s - 429.9s] (Chunk 023)
Thanks.
