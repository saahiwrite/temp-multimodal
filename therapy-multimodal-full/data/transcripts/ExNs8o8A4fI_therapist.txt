[0.2s - 33.9s] (Chunk 001)
Sa, you've said that when you're in work, you worry a lot about how you come across in social situations.

[41.5s - 44.8s] (Chunk 002)
Yeah. You said that you worry that you visibly shake.

[46.7s - 49.5s] (Chunk 003)
Are there any other things that you worry that people will notice?

[61.1s - 66.0s] (Chunk 004)
So it sounds like you have quite a strong mental image of how you see yourself when you're in these social situations.

[67.6s - 76.1s] (Chunk 005)
So you go red, you shake. Is there anything else that you think that you do? I mean, describe yourself. How do you think you look when you're in these situations?

[91.5s - 98.2s] (Chunk 006)
Is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things, to manage these problems?

[117.2s - 122.3s] (Chunk 007)
So you focus on something. You grip onto the camera. Do you make eye contact with people?

[125.6s - 130.5s] (Chunk 008)
Okay, so you also avoid eye contact. Is there anything else that you do to manage the sweating?

[144.8s - 156.4s] (Chunk 009)
Okay. What do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things? If you stopped gripping onto the camera or, you know, you started making eye contact and not looking down? What do you think would happen?

[172.0s - 184.6s] (Chunk 010)
What I'm thinking now is, how would you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things? If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work?

[187.3s - 201.8s] (Chunk 011)
And if you did this maybe twice, and the first time you do all the things that you normally do, you grip onto something, look down. Is there anything else that you do when you're in these situations, these work conversations, to try and cope?

[218.7s - 231.8s] (Chunk 012)
Okay, so in the first time, I want you to do those things as much as you normally would. In fact, maybe even slightly more than you normally would. And then the second time, I want you to drop doing those things altogether. How does that sound?

[234.4s - 239.2s] (Chunk 013)
And do you. How would you feel about if we filmed this so you could actually see what you looked like?

[240.3s - 242.6s] (Chunk 014)
Do you have a camera with you that we could video on?

[244.9s - 257.0s] (Chunk 015)
Yeah, yeah, we'll use that in just a sec. Okay. Before we do this, then, we're just going to fill out this form because what we're doing now is an experiment. We call it a behavioral experiment to see what happens when you change the way that you're behaving.

[257.6s - 271.7s] (Chunk 016)
Okay. So the first column says, I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have. So that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work. Who should I play? If you're playing yourself in this role play, who should I be?

[280.8s - 292.5s] (Chunk 017)
Okay, so would it work if I was maybe having a wedding and I was hiring you to be a wedding photographer? What kind of problems do you see coming up in this conversation that we have? Like, what will you see yourself doing on camera?

[298.6s - 309.0s] (Chunk 018)
Okay, so visibly shaking. So how. How much will you be shaking? If 100 is, like, shaking uncontrollably and 0 is not shaking at all, how visibly shaking will you be?

[310.7s - 317.8s] (Chunk 019)
Okay, sorry, what was the other thing that you just said?

[319.9s - 321.3s] (Chunk 020)
Okay, so you're gonna go red?

[323.0s - 326.2s] (Chunk 021)
How red will you go? I mean, if we look around this room.

[330.2s - 335.4s] (Chunk 022)
Okay, so, yeah, you're gonna be as kind of brightly pink as these chairs are.

[335.9s - 340.8s] (Chunk 023)
Okay, so out of a hundred, then. How. How pink would you say These chairs are?

[344.8s - 349.0s] (Chunk 024)
Okay. What else are you worried is going to happen when we have these conversations?

[357.6s - 359.9s] (Chunk 025)
Okay. And how stupid out of 100?

[365.3s - 365.7s] (Chunk 026)
Okay.

[368.3s - 374.3s] (Chunk 027)
What Else are you worried will happen when we have this conversation? What else might you see on the camera?

[378.2s - 382.6s] (Chunk 028)
Okay. And how much will you be sweating.

[385.7s - 389.5s] (Chunk 029)
Ninety, I think, like visibly sweating down the face.

[391.1s - 400.1s] (Chunk 030)
Okay. And what do you think will happen the second time around when you stop kind of doing the things you normally do to cope? When you maybe start to make eye contact and you're not gripping on something?

[404.1s - 408.5s] (Chunk 031)
How. How much worse? Slightly worse. Like twice as bad.

[410.4s - 410.9s] (Chunk 032)
Okay.

[412.7s - 413.3s] (Chunk 033)
Okay.

[414.3s - 416.2s] (Chunk 034)
If you can you give me your phone and we'll.

[420.8s - 423.2s] (Chunk 035)
Okay. Okay.

[425.4s - 427.4s] (Chunk 036)
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Probably best.

[430.1s - 443.7s] (Chunk 037)
Okay. Hi. So I was just wondering if I could talk to you about maybe doing my wedding photography.

[453.4s - 461.9s] (Chunk 038)
I suppose I'd like lots of shots of our family and our friends. Quite a lot of natural shots, you know, of people talking when they're having drinks.

[470.8s - 483.0s] (Chunk 039)
It's going to be a summer wedding, so we quite like a lot of outdoors shots, if possible. You know, if it's not raining. That would be quite nice. Yeah. Quite some arty ones, if that's possible.

[488.6s - 491.9s] (Chunk 040)
So have you got anything that you could show me about your past work?

[506.3s - 511.0s] (Chunk 041)
Okay, great. Right, let's do the second one now.

[511.6s - 520.8s] (Chunk 042)
Okay. You ready to put down the bottle and just to make eye contact. Okay. Hi. So I was just wondering if I could speak to you about doing my wedding photography.

[527.5s - 534.3s] (Chunk 043)
I'd like kind of lots of shots of family and friends. Friends. And quite a lot of natural shots, you know.

[541.3s - 556.7s] (Chunk 044)
Yeah. Because it's going to be a summer wedding and, you know, weather dependent, of course. It would be really great if we could kind of get lots of shots, you know, outdoors of. Yeah. People chatting and maybe some quite arty ones as well. Yeah. Have you got anything that you could show me about your past work.

[572.3s - 574.3s] (Chunk 045)
Okay, let's pause it there.

[575.1s - 577.1s] (Chunk 046)
Right. I'm just going to give you this back now to look at.

[578.2s - 584.6s] (Chunk 047)
And I just want you to watch that. Okay. And then we'll just chat about it a moment. Okay.

[590.5s - 599.0s] (Chunk 048)
So if we just go back to the things that you predicted, then you. You said that you thought you were going to shake, visibly shake. Could you see yourself shaking on the video?

[609.0s - 616.2s] (Chunk 049)
Mm. So you said that you were gonna shake 90 out of 100. How much shaking would you say that you saw there in the end?

[619.4s - 630.6s] (Chunk 050)
Okay. You said that you were gonna go red or pink, as pink as these chairs. 90 out of a hundred. Did you notice yourself going pink?

[639.8s - 648.8s] (Chunk 051)
Okay. You said that you were worried that you were going to say something stupid. 90 out of a hundred. Did you say anything stupid?

[654.3s - 663.8s] (Chunk 052)
So you thought you were going to be, like, 90. Say something that was 90% stupid. That's really quite strong. I mean, in the end, did you pick up anything that. So could we maybe put that as a zero?

[670.4s - 672.2s] (Chunk 053)
You said that you thought you were going to be sweating.

[673.2s - 678.5s] (Chunk 054)
And that you were going to be visibly sweating. Did you notice yourself sweating in the end?

[681.6s - 688.1s] (Chunk 055)
Again, you thought you were going to be, like, 90 out of 100. Seriously visibly sweating. So what's got. Would you actually give it in the end?

[693.4s - 698.5s] (Chunk 056)
You also said that you thought it was going to be twice as bad when you stopped using your, you know, your normal strategies.

[699.0s - 700.9s] (Chunk 057)
What did you notice watching that video?
