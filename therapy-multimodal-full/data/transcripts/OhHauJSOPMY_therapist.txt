[14.2s - 15.2s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Emma. How are you doing today?

[17.3s - 25.2s] (Chunk 002)
I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I understand that you've come here today because you've had some symptoms that have been bothering you.

[35.8s - 40.1s] (Chunk 003)
You've lost three jobs in the past year? Is it because of the anxiety?

[67.5s - 86.4s] (Chunk 004)
Alright. So you have a. You have a system you go through of unplugging different objects in your apartment and you're worried that they're going to cause problem if they're left plugged in.

[93.2s - 96.0s] (Chunk 005)
So you're afraid that if you leave them plugged in, they'll overheat?

[97.2s - 99.2s] (Chunk 006)
And your apartment will catch on fire.

[100.5s - 104.4s] (Chunk 007)
And you have a particular order you go in as you unplug?

[107.2s - 114.6s] (Chunk 008)
What happens if you're unplugging the items and you get distracted or something interrupts that?

[123.0s - 129.4s] (Chunk 009)
Will you plug the objects back in or how will you do it? For the items that are already unplugged.

[136.6s - 138.1s] (Chunk 010)
I should go back and plug them in?

[138.6s - 144.3s] (Chunk 011)
Unplug them. What's your anxiety level like as you start that process?

[146.5s - 147.1s] (Chunk 012)
Is it?

[148.4s - 150.1s] (Chunk 013)
How about toward the end of the process?

[162.0s - 175.7s] (Chunk 014)
Okay. So when it comes back, everything's unplugged. So you have to plug everything back in and unplug it and go through the whole process again. It's just pretty distressing.

[178.2s - 183.8s] (Chunk 015)
And you think that this is what led to the problems with employment?

[220.0s - 222.9s] (Chunk 016)
So your employer wasn't happy with that?

[224.2s - 225.8s] (Chunk 017)
And that led to you losing your job?

[227.5s - 228.6s] (Chunk 018)
Are you working now?

[258.6s - 271.1s] (Chunk 019)
Wasn't a good fit. All right, so these symptoms have caused you some real problems with employment. And how about with your anxiety level?

[276.4s - 290.2s] (Chunk 020)
If we were to put on a scale, like, where 1 was very little anxiety and 10 was the worst anxiety you've ever experienced, what kind of anxiety are you having on a daily basis now?

[293.4s - 295.1s] (Chunk 021)
A 10. So the worst ever?

[297.2s - 305.5s] (Chunk 022)
And checking the doors, checking light switches, unplugging everything. This reduces your anxiety for a while.

[309.1s - 310.2s] (Chunk 023)
But then it comes back.

[313.0s - 318.5s] (Chunk 024)
Is there anything else that you do that helps to reduce the anxiety?

[356.7s - 359.5s] (Chunk 025)
Do you know how long you've had these symptoms?

[366.6s - 367.8s] (Chunk 026)
So sometime.

[368.8s - 372.2s] (Chunk 027)
Did they start off like they are now or are they different?

[392.5s - 395.3s] (Chunk 028)
Was it the same thing? That it helped reduce anxiety?

[397.7s - 398.9s] (Chunk 029)
Did it cause you any trouble?

[409.4s - 414.6s] (Chunk 030)
Were you ever taken somewhere and diagnosed or treated?

[422.1s - 426.6s] (Chunk 031)
And now it's. Now it's the worst it's ever been.

[430.8s - 436.2s] (Chunk 032)
Do you feel like you're able to go back to work with the symptoms the way they are now?

[441.4s - 442.7s] (Chunk 033)
Because they're so disruptive.

[446.1s - 449.1s] (Chunk 034)
Have you ever had any medical conditions?

[451.0s - 461.1s] (Chunk 035)
Nothing. All right. And have you ever used or. Do you use any type of drug or alcohol?

[462.4s - 477.3s] (Chunk 036)
None. Emma, I want to thank you for coming in. I'm gonna get you scheduled to see one of our counselors. I appreciate you spending this time with me. It's helped me to understand what you're going through.

[478.5s - 478.9s] (Chunk 037)
Thanks.
