Leah, I want to thank you for your participation so far in this intake, but I want to move to another section of the intake, specifically your family history, if that's okay with you. Yes. All right, so I'm gonna be asking you various questions about your relatives, okay?

[35.6s - 36.8s] (Chunk 002)
Are you adopted?

All right, so it's a bunch. Well, she was married to your father.

Alright, how about your relationship with your mother?

[252.4s - 255.1s] (Chunk 018)

[257.3s - 257.7s] (Chunk 019)
Yeah.

[283.3s - 290.9s] (Chunk 020)
Do you think the way that you're raised has an impact on who you are now in terms of.

[431.8s - 433.9s] (Chunk 026)
You're satisfied with your relationship with them?
