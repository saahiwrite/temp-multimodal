[15.1s - 25.5s] (Chunk 001)
I just want to change gears again. I want to talk about any potential trauma or abuse. Are you comfortable with that topic?

[26.4s - 41.2s] (Chunk 002)
I mentioned earlier there's been no occasions where you've had non consensual sexual contact. What about physical abuse? No, nothing. How about emotional abuse?

[49.4s - 50.0s] (Chunk 003)
Tell me.

[66.9s - 69.1s] (Chunk 004)
Can you give me an example of something he might have said?

[72.6s - 73.0s] (Chunk 005)
Or.

[88.0s - 89.4s] (Chunk 006)
Fairly strong statements.

[91.5s - 93.6s] (Chunk 007)
What's that feel like when he says things like that?

[103.0s - 104.6s] (Chunk 008)
You feel like you're numb to it now.

[112.4s - 113.8s] (Chunk 009)
Still gotta be a little painful.

[123.6s - 132.7s] (Chunk 010)
Has there ever been a change in your anxiety levels or your drinking when he would make comments like that?

[158.2s - 160.5s] (Chunk 011)
Would you consider this a significant, significant part of your history?

[163.3s - 168.5s] (Chunk 012)
No. I mean, it seems a little upsetting to you to say the least, right?

[172.5s - 175.5s] (Chunk 013)
Something maybe we can talk about later. Yeah.

[181.5s - 188.8s] (Chunk 014)
So I want to switch gears again a little bit. What do you do for fun, for recreation.

[192.8s - 195.2s] (Chunk 015)
Well, okay, I'll put that in there. Partying, that's one thing.

[195.9s - 199.9s] (Chunk 016)
Okay. Yeah. So other than that, I like to shop.

[205.2s - 208.0s] (Chunk 017)
Hiking. Okay. When's the last time you were hiking?

[210.6s - 213.4s] (Chunk 018)
It's been a while. Okay. What else?

[230.8s - 239.2s] (Chunk 019)
Okay, live shows. Like theater or like, music. Oh, okay. Like music. When's the last time you've done that?

[242.1s - 248.5s] (Chunk 020)
A year. Do you consider your life to be fun?

[253.3s - 258.1s] (Chunk 021)
Has it ever been? I don't know.

[266.3s - 269.1s] (Chunk 022)
When was the last instance that you could remember?

[272.9s - 274.6s] (Chunk 023)
So there's little moments here and there.

[275.4s - 277.8s] (Chunk 024)
But consistently not the case?

[288.1s - 334.2s] (Chunk 025)
Okay. I want to switch gears again and ask you about any type of. Any time in your life when you may have had suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Have you ever had a time when you contemplated suicide? No, never. And right now it's not something you're thinking about. What do you think has protected you against having any type of suicidal thoughts?

[348.2s - 355.6s] (Chunk 026)
Now. How about harm to others? Have you thought about harming some? No. Never. What do you think protects you against that?

[358.8s - 359.4s] (Chunk 027)
Nice person?

[359.8s - 364.0s] (Chunk 028)
Okay. You ever get angry?

[369.1s - 373.5s] (Chunk 029)
But it's never translated to anything where you had any desire to hurt anybody?

[373.8s - 375.3s] (Chunk 030)
So you deal with anger pretty well?

[376.5s - 397.9s] (Chunk 031)
Okay, good. All right. Again, some of these questions. Questions I'm aware, probably don't reply, but I want to go through them just in case. Has there ever been a time where you heard or saw something that other people did not hear or see?

[400.2s - 401.2s] (Chunk 032)
Like a hallucination?

[401.8s - 423.6s] (Chunk 033)
No. Other than perhaps under the influence of alcohol, was there ever a time you felt out of touch with reality? Okay. How would you describe your judgment? Making decisions.

[428.1s - 432.1s] (Chunk 034)
When you're sober, I think it's pretty good. Yeah. Good judgment.

[439.1s - 440.5s] (Chunk 035)
And when you're under the influence?

[442.4s - 457.1s] (Chunk 036)
Not as good. Okay. Any questions for me so far?

[459.7s - 490.7s] (Chunk 037)
Yeah, I've been asking a lot of questions. Huh? Yeah, I know. We're almost through. I appreciate you bearing with me. I'd like to talk about your goals, and I want to talk about two levels. Right. So your goals in life. So this is like your general goals and then your specific goals for your time with me. So let's start with your general goals for your life. What would you like?

[510.9s - 511.3s] (Chunk 038)
Mm.

[517.8s - 518.6s] (Chunk 039)
Live on your own?

[523.6s - 528.0s] (Chunk 040)
Any other life goals? Any goals surrounding family or anything like that?

[535.0s - 536.2s] (Chunk 041)
How about having your own family?

[539.2s - 560.2s] (Chunk 042)
Okay. If you think of any other goals later on or answers to these questions of any nature, feel free to just add that in. Okay. So we can go back and edit this and add to it. How about goals for treatment?

[568.5s - 569.1s] (Chunk 043)
Anxiety.

[578.5s - 580.4s] (Chunk 044)
Okay. Graduating college.

[583.8s - 584.8s] (Chunk 045)
What was that last part?

[586.6s - 596.8s] (Chunk 046)
Oh, yeah. Surviving the last year of college. Sure. Okay. Drinking, anxiety, graduating college. Anything else that would be a goal Therapy.

[601.2s - 632.3s] (Chunk 047)
All right. So if you could meet those three goals, you feel like the counseling would have been successful? Yeah. So one last area I want to cover with you. What do you consider your strengths that are going to help you to meet these goals and to meet your life goals?

[636.0s - 639.8s] (Chunk 048)
Okay. You're ready? Yeah. That's good. What else?

[652.4s - 653.0s] (Chunk 049)
Mm.

[661.2s - 663.3s] (Chunk 050)
So hard worker. All right.

[669.1s - 672.1s] (Chunk 051)
Understanding? How about intelligent?

[674.5s - 676.7s] (Chunk 052)
You guess so? Yeah. Okay.

[678.3s - 683.9s] (Chunk 053)
Never thought about it. How about social skills?

[692.8s - 696.6s] (Chunk 054)
Do you think about the future a lot? What your future's gonna be like?

[698.1s - 698.5s] (Chunk 055)
Yeah.

[701.9s - 703.0s] (Chunk 056)
How's it look to you right now?

[706.4s - 713.8s] (Chunk 057)
Yeah. Okay. Well, we'll try to work on that. Okay.

[724.0s - 730.8s] (Chunk 058)
All right. Are there any other questions that you want to ask me before we wrap up intake?

[733.8s - 734.1s] (Chunk 059)
What's that?

[734.8s - 772.6s] (Chunk 060)
That was a lot. Yeah. We did cover a lot. As I mentioned. If you have any other questions about this at any time, we can come back and revisit this. Okay. We can add on to it. And likely as we go through the sessions, I'll have even more questions. Maybe not as intensely packaged. All at one time like this was. But I'll have more questions for you. And I appreciate you answering the questions. I know some of them probably a bit challenging to talk. So I'm going to finish this up and I'm going to get you scheduled to see it about a week. Does that work for you?

[773.7s - 776.6s] (Chunk 061)
We'll get started with the counseling sessions.

[777.6s - 778.4s] (Chunk 062)
All right, Sam.

[778.8s - 779.7s] (Chunk 063)
Thank you. Thanks.
