[14.4s - 15.5s] (Chunk 001)
Hey, Erica. How you doing today?

[17.6s - 38.8s] (Chunk 002)
You're doing good. I was hoping today we could revisit the two chair technique. We used it a few sessions ago, you might remember. And I know in the last sess, I felt like we were kind of getting to a point where we identified a conflict. You know what I'm referring to.

[50.2s - 77.7s] (Chunk 003)
So we have a part that wants to settle down and a part that wants to keep going with the career. So for this two chair, what I'd like to do is in the chair where you're seated now, this will be the emotional self. In this case, the side that wants to pursue the career.

[79.2s - 80.6s] (Chunk 004)
From what I saw before, that seems.

[82.9s - 84.6s] (Chunk 005)
You're more emotionally connected. That's what you want.

[85.7s - 98.3s] (Chunk 006)
So this will be the side of you that has the needs and the wants and more the emotion. Okay. So that's who you. You'll be in this chair. That makes sense.

[99.2s - 119.2s] (Chunk 007)
In the other chair, let's have that critic that's inside, that internal critic that's advocating for settling down, for getting married, for having kids. In a way, it represents a societal pressure.

[122.2s - 127.7s] (Chunk 008)
Do those two sides seem separate to you?

[132.2s - 137.1s] (Chunk 009)
You feel like you can be the emotional self here and the internal critic there?

[138.8s - 172.4s] (Chunk 010)
Okay, so I think you remember how this works. You'll be talking to, in this case, the internal critic. So the internal critic's on the side of settling down, getting married, and then when you're ready to have the critic respond, you'll switch to that chair and respond to the emotional need, driven and wanting side. Make sense? Yeah. Okay, so whenever you're ready, go ahead and speak directly to the internal critic.

[211.8s - 213.4s] (Chunk 011)
So you've made your statement? Yeah. You ready to switch?

[213.8s - 216.6s] (Chunk 012)
Okay. Go ahead, switch. So now you're the internal critic.

[262.2s - 290.5s] (Chunk 013)
The internal critic cues in the emotional side, in this case the career side. Being selfish. Now notice your posture. Very linear and you're upright. I notice you kind of put your hand out a little bit when you were talking. Try to think of the internal critic's body movements. Try to act that out a little bit.

[328.7s - 330.5s] (Chunk 014)
You want to jump at the emotional side?

[333.7s - 338.6s] (Chunk 015)
Alright, so that's the internal critic. Are you ready to respond back to the internal critic from the emotional side?

[342.4s - 352.7s] (Chunk 016)
Okay, so the internal critic is just called you selfish and among other things, this is your response.

[373.4s - 390.8s] (Chunk 017)
Let me interrupt you. So your hands are pointing back toward the career emotional self. What can you do with your hands that really embody what you want to communicate to the internal critic? Is there anything else you want to do right now? They are pointing toward you.

[409.5s - 414.6s] (Chunk 018)
So continue and have. Use that motion. You're pushing the internal critic away.

[416.6s - 417.0s] (Chunk 019)
All right.

[442.7s - 450.6s] (Chunk 020)
Does the internal critic have something to say back? No. All right.

[456.4s - 461.6s] (Chunk 021)
Okay, so you've now pushed the emotional side, has pushed the critic away.

[504.1s - 517.5s] (Chunk 022)
All right, so the internal critic is. Now you have your hands down here as the internal critic. Is the internal critic less angry, less assertive?

[521.1s - 521.8s] (Chunk 023)
Less pushy.

[541.5s - 551.3s] (Chunk 024)
So the critic is more separated now, maybe a little bit, but also has a different outlook, more quiet.

[565.8s - 569.8s] (Chunk 025)
So the critic has lost some of its vigor and determination.

[573.4s - 577.5s] (Chunk 026)
So move back to the emotional and then just face toward me.

[580.5s - 588.3s] (Chunk 027)
What have you. What have you gained here through your communication back and forth with the internal critic?

[628.2s - 648.4s] (Chunk 028)
So at the end of this conflict, after we split into the two parts here, the end of this conflict is eventually a decision. It's a decision to pursue a career or settle down. Do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision?

[663.1s - 672.0s] (Chunk 029)
So that's really been your decision all along, but the internal critic was harassing you this whole time?

[674.3s - 687.5s] (Chunk 030)
And today you were able to kind of shove that internal critic back a little and allow that internal critic to see how strongly you feel with the decision you've made.

[688.3s - 689.1s] (Chunk 031)
Is that accurate?

[691.0s - 693.1s] (Chunk 032)
Do you feel it was helpful technique for you?

[706.2s - 708.6s] (Chunk 033)
So it was able to give you some clarity.

[709.5s - 741.3s] (Chunk 034)
Right. All right, well, let's. Why don't you reflect on what's happened here between now and the next session? Kind of a lot happened, and it seems like you've gained clarity for your decision. And then we'll pick up with the next session and see how things have progressed with. See if that internal critic is still harassing you or if it kind of stays back and if you have more peace with the decision. That sound like a plan?

[742.5s - 744.2s] (Chunk 035)
Thanks, Erica. I'll see you next week.
