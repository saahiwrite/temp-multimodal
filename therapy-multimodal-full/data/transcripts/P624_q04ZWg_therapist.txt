[14.0s - 15.2s] (Chunk 001)
Hi, Jackie. How you doing today?

[18.7s - 25.6s] (Chunk 002)
You all right? Yeah, I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I understand you've had some recent difficulties that brought you into our agency.

[28.5s - 29.4s] (Chunk 003)
You lost your job.

[34.0s - 35.6s] (Chunk 004)
You failed a drug test? Mm.

[85.4s - 88.9s] (Chunk 005)
Were you aware that if there was an accident you'd be drug tested?

[102.7s - 105.3s] (Chunk 006)
So. Have there been consequences to losing your job?

[132.5s - 133.7s] (Chunk 007)
What type of work do you do?

[143.1s - 147.9s] (Chunk 008)
Alright, so most of those employers would require a drug screen.

[182.2s - 183.4s] (Chunk 009)
You think it should be legal?

[198.2s - 201.2s] (Chunk 010)
So you want to stop using marijuana altogether?

[208.1s - 212.2s] (Chunk 011)
Alright, can you tell me about your marijuana use now? Like when was the last time you used?

[229.2s - 234.9s] (Chunk 012)
All right, so recently. And how about the course? Like when did you start using marijuana?

[254.5s - 258.5s] (Chunk 013)
All right. Any other drugs or alcohol or anything? Just marijuana?

[262.3s - 265.1s] (Chunk 014)
Have you noticed over time you've been using more?

[289.2s - 292.8s] (Chunk 015)
So it's consuming a lot of time. Marijuana?

[306.8s - 308.6s] (Chunk 016)
Alright. You have a craving for marijuana?

[316.2s - 319.5s] (Chunk 017)
Now, have you had any social problems because of your marijuana use?

[325.6s - 326.2s] (Chunk 018)
Just the work.

[329.5s - 338.0s] (Chunk 019)
So are there other important activities that you miss out on because of your marijuana use outside of work?

[348.2s - 355.4s] (Chunk 020)
You don't miss much. Are there any activities that you engage in that are more dangerous because of your marijuana use?

[367.2s - 375.6s] (Chunk 021)
Do you have any history of mental health issues or medical issues? No, nothing like that?

[379.9s - 385.8s] (Chunk 022)
Do you notice any anxiety or physical symptoms when you stop using marijuana?

[389.8s - 390.4s] (Chunk 023)
You feel okay?

[392.9s - 396.1s] (Chunk 024)
So how motivated are you to stop using?

[411.8s - 412.6s] (Chunk 025)
You're committed to it.

[415.3s - 418.2s] (Chunk 026)
I'm gonna get you in to see a counselor here, if that's okay with you.

[420.1s - 426.2s] (Chunk 027)
That'd be helpful. And I appreciate you taking this time to tell me what's going on and answer my questions. It's been helpful.
