So I want to stress a few. One, it's important to watch all three parts of the video, Part one, part two, and part three. Second, your agency may have different requirements for a comprehensive intake than what you'll see on this video. And third, each client is an individual, so you may have to add or subtract different components of the clinical interview to meet their needs and to provide professional and ethical counseling service. So I'm going to have now review some of the elements you're going to see in part one of this video.",

I'm going to talk about what they need to know, which is usually, what type of insurance does she have? Or is there a change in insurance coming? Or something like that. The questions they're asking me aren't typically of personal nature, and if they were, I wouldn't answer them. However, with the director of the agency, that would be a different level of disclosure.

I have to, and I have the ability to, and the authority to take steps to prevent you from harming yourself or somebody else. I'll only disclose what information I need to. To prevent you from harming yourself or somebody else. So if you say to me that you're going to harm yourself and again, you leave the office, and that's kind of the way we leave it. Like, you say that and you run out, and I, in that instance, would probably call the police. I'm going to say, you know, information like your name. I'm going to take a guess at your height and tell them your age. Take a guess at your weight. Try to remember what you're wearing, describe where you live, like your address, but not get into all kinds of detail about your treatment here. Just what the law enforcement officer would need to know to intercept you and to keep you safe. Okay? Does that make sense? And the same would apply in the case if you had made a threat to harm somebody else. So I want to emphasize with this point that if you tell me that you have suicidal Thoughts or homicidal thoughts. That doesn't necessarily mean law enforcement or inpatient facilities are going to be involved. Okay, we can talk about it. And a lot of people, especially if they have any type of depression, have suicidal thoughts. It's extremely common. And homicidal thoughts are actually fairly common as well. Rarely are they acted upon, but they're common thoughts. So I want you to feel free to discuss those without fear that I'm just going to reach for the phone and call the police, because that's not going to be the case. But if there's a clear threat, and I'm really worried, then I will act. And all this is actually to protect you and the public. Another exception to confidentiality is if you provide information to me that leads me to believe a child or an elderly person is being abused. Now, interestingly, with this exception, it doesn't matter if you're the abuser or not. You could tell me about your neighbor and how on your way to therapy, you saw that person abusing their child. And I would have to report that. Okay. And again, I would just give them the information they need to try to prevent any harm to the child or an elderly person. Does that make sense? Okay. And the last exception to confidentiality would be. And this is very rare, but it can happen, so I won't tell you about it. If for some reason, during the course of this therapy or even after this therapy has terminated, you get involved with the civil legal system and the criminal legal system, and a judge orders me to disclose information from your chart or from our experiences, technically a judge can do that, and I would have to follow his or her orders before I would make any such disclosure. I would certainly make my case to the judge that I don't want to make that disclosure and try to restrict that disclosure as much as possible. But in the end, it's important to know that I don't have the power to make the final decision. It would be in the hands of the judge. Again, this happens very rarely, but I do want to let you know that it is an exception to confidentiality.",

I'm here with Nell Kelly, a graduate assistant here at Wilmington University, and she'll be role playing the same character, Anne, in part two and all the parts of these videos. So I remind this is just for educational purposes and your agency may have different requirements when it comes to what needs to be included in a clinical interview. And remember, all clients are individuals, so you may need to add or subtract different elements to provide an ethical and appropriate clinical interview. So I'll turn it over to Nell to introduce some of the elements you'll be seeing in part two.",

Anger's a good thing in a way because it's letting you know that something wasn't right and wasn't fair, that he just did change the thing without your permission, without you knowing. So in some ways you had a right to be angry. But what happens, what I heard you say as you were telling me what happened next? What happened next was that your anger took charge and it did more than what it's meant to do. Your anger is just to let you know that you're angry.

Sometimes when babies are born, you can't be certain what sex the baby is. And it's really important not to say one thing and then be wrong. In lots of cases, what you see is, you know, when you look in a baby's nappy, you see something which you're not sure is either a kind of very swollen vagina, very swollen clitoris, or a very small penis. And that's the case with your baby. Okay. So it may be that in 24 hours the swelling has subsided, and it's very clear that the baby's one sex or another, but for now, we can't be sure.",

And we'd still like those tests to reassure us, but it might be that there's nothing wrong at all. Okay. The test that we do is we'll do some tests looking at the baby's genes.

What we can do is we don't know, and I don't want to start talking in great detail about the different possibilities until we know what it is. So what we're going to do is we're going to do two tests in the immediate term, and that's to see whether the baby has got chromosomes of a boy or chromosomes of a girl. That's the genes of a boy or the genes of a girl. So we know what their genetic makeup is. And we'll do this other test looking for this hormone problem, and they will give us a lot of information in the first instance, and then we will take it from there, thinking about, you know, what, if anything, we need to do. So as I say, it may be that your baby is totally normal. If they have one of these hormone problems, that is something that we can treat very easily. So what are we going to do now? Because, you know, our relatives keep coming in and they're like, what's, what's his name? So I think the best way to approach it is to just say sometimes it's not clear and it may become clearer, and they're just going to do some tests. Are the tests going to hurt the baby? So the test that we're going to do in the first instance of blood tests, so that's just a prick with a needle. And babies at this age aren't normally bothered by blood tests. And then after that, we might go on in the next few days to do some more tests. But I can talk about those if and when we need to do them. Okay.",

This sometimes happens, and it sometimes turns out to be nothing. Okay. Occasionally. And the commonest and most urgent thing for us to work out is if it's a hormone problem. So that's why we're doing the blood tests and we're also doing some genetic tests to look at what sex. What genetic sex the baby is. So if the baby's got the chromosomes of a girl or a boy. So they will help us. So we'll have much more information in a day or two, but we won't get those tests back straight away because it takes a bit of time. And so just for now, if you can bear to. It's just better if. Of course, you can have the baby with you and you can start bonding with the baby and introduce the baby to everyone. But just. We can't be sure at the moment.

You know, an alarm is going off in your brain, and that alarm, normally it indicates fight, flight, or freeze. So makes you want to fight, fight back. Right. It makes you want to freeze. Just kind of depending. Freeze, don't know what you do. Or flight, which means get out of there, you know, get away. All right, so that's kind of what your brain. That's the alarm system. That's kind of your brain. So let's think about some situations when you're in these angry situations, and let's just kind of step through them.

You know, it's great when you can take 15 minutes to calm down. Maybe you're going to bed at night and you're doing something that makes you calm down and it's quiet. But a lot of time in the heat of the moment, we don't have a lot of time. Or when you feel that anger rising, there's not a lot of time. All right? It happens a lot. Okay. This little procedure is called stop S T O P. Alright? It's a little acronym. S T O P. So S T O P. So it means the first, the S is to stop. So for example, you're watching TV and your mom says, alyssa, can you do the dishes, please? All right. Right then and there you're going to say, okay, stop. And then you're going to take a breath, okay? You're going to breathe in pretty deeply and you're going to breathe out. Just like take two deep breaths and think about your breathing. Breathe in and breathe out. Okay? So the T is for Take a breath. Alright. Take a breath. Alright. And when you're taking a breath, think about, you know, your brain really needs a lot of oxygen. So when you're breathing in, you're breathing oxygen into your lungs, gets into your blood, gets to your brain, you're getting a lot of oxygen in your brain, which really helps you think better, alright? So you're breathing in, getting that oxygen right there, alright? The O means observe what is going on around you right now. Alright? So in this situation, your mom asks you to do the dishes, you're watching a program, alright? You'd like to finish the program, I think I heard you say, and then you're going to do the dishes. That's how you would like it. May not be how momma would like it, but, but you might be able to if you can kind of get. Observe the situation and how you're feeling. I'm a little mad. Mom just asked me to do this. Doesn't she see, I'm like watching my show here. Alright, so you're observing how you're feeling. Alright? Watching the show. I'm getting frustrated that she's asking me to do this right now. Observe it, name it, claim it and say, okay, that's how I'm feeling right now. Alright, so you're just aware, you're observing the situation and how you're feeling. Okay? And then. So the O is for observe and the P is for proceed. That means move forward with something that's gonna benefit you, that's gonna be positive, that's gonna work for you. Yelling at your mom, is that working for you? Get you in trouble, get your hand in the wall, you might get hurt. Moving forward, yelling at your mom's not working for you too well, is it? Okay, so we're going to proceed with something that's going to work for you in this situation. Do you have an idea that might work for you?",

Can you think of a way that might benefit you more? It might be to your advantage. Getting out of the room and going down the hall is not helping you too much. So what's a way you can proceed? You are frustrated. You are maybe a little bit embarrassed. Maybe don't know the answer. What can you do instead? Yell at that teacher and get angry at her? You have a thought. Maybe.",

    "text": "Hi, my name is Annie Hinos and I'm a graduate student at the University of Nevada, Reno. In this video, I will be providing instructions on how to use techniques from dialectical behavior therapy when working with a client with an eating disorder. Specifically, I'm going to be walking you through an example of using DBT skills during a food exposure exercise. When working with clients with eating disorders, it's important to understand how to implement DBT skills in the context of eating. This is because for clients with eating disorders, eating can often be a very stressful, though certainly necessary, task. These skills that I'll be demonstrating in this video can be used either in a food exposure exercise, as we'll show in the upcoming clip, or else can be used during telephone coaching calls, as is standard in dbt. In this video clip, I'll be using emotion regulation skills specifically, and the overall goal when using emotion regulation techniques is to help the client to, number one, identify a primary emotion while blocking any expressions of secondary emotions. Two, validate that primary emotion, helping the client to know that this reaction makes sense and is understood by the therapist. Three, figuring out with the client how to treat this emotion using DBT skills. And four, reinforcing the client's use of these DBT skills through cheerleading and praise. Of note. In this video clip, I will also be eating alongside the client. And this is in order to model healthy normative eating behavior to the client as well as to demonstrate to her that I'm willing to engage in the same exposure exercises that I'm asking of her. So I hope you enjoy the video and find it informative. What's going on? What are you feeling right now?",

This is information that I want to take back, but I want to make sure that I have it all correct. So if I've forgotten something or I've gotten something incorrect, please, please help me. You came to the clinic today for a complaint of left elbow pain. And it's pain that you mostly noticed when you were bending it or using it in some capacity. It's a throbbing pain that happens randomly, but it does happen two to three times during the day. What you notice about is if you exert or you extend or flex your elbow at all, that's when it seems to be at its worst. It's gone on for about a week, maybe to two weeks when you think back on it. And it started out when you were helping your husband clean the garage and you were lifting lots of boxes. It's about a 6 to 7 on a pain scale. And you describe it over and over as being a nuisance, which tells me that it's getting kind of in the way of doing some things that you want to. You report that it happens probably two to three times a day and that the pain wraps around the joint completely. You've taken some Tylenol for it across the counter. You've taken that several times a day. Not without much relief. That hasn't helped much. You've also tried a heating pad. You've tried some ice. That hasn't really helped either. Too much, it sounds like, again, you kept referring to it as a nuisance, that it's just kind of getting in the way of your daily activities. It doesn't necessarily keep you up at night, but you do notice it at night when you wake up, that it's still going on for you. So sleep doesn't seem to help much. And that what you mostly think this could be is a pulled muscle of some type. Is there anything I've forgotten or that you wanted to tell me about this?",

Going numb, stopping from telling the story or hiding from the story, and get into showing up to willingness, being able to have the experience that perhaps in the future it can free her to act on a more workable agenda.",

Getting her to recognize the emotion that she's experiencing in the moment is what you would do in act. However, once that emotion is recognized in the name of validation, I change and move in to try and comfort her in some way, letting her know that she's not alone, that it makes sense that she feels that way. And although that may be helpful in small ways, probably in the long run, will not help this client find a place where she can be flexible and more willing in such a way that her values are actively chosen. So there's a place here where I allowed her to escape. And in that escape we reinforced the notion of control. So in this segment, we're going to be working on competency seven, and here we're going to look at the Cost of unwillingness relative to valued life ends. This particular client is struggling with her relationship with her boyfriend. She's feeling rejected and is trying to overcome her emotional experience around that rejection.",

In this couple of clips, we're going to look at a client who is looking ahead to doing an exposure exercise as part of act. The client is experiencing a panic disorder and has been nearly housebound for many years. And we've gotten to the point now where we have some of these skills in place, and we're going to go out and search for Mr. Anxiety. And this is the process of negotiating that exposure session.

It looks like somebody who may have read some ACT books thinks they kind of understand it, trying to mix it perhaps with traditional cbt. But you could see in a couple areas that it's inconsistent. For example, we wouldn't take the probability that you're going to lose it and hang on to that as a thought, as if you should, by believing that, fend off other thoughts. The other part is we used a little diffusion technology, the President Bush exercise, but we did it to sort of ridicule and make fun of the thoughts, to belittle them as if to make them go away, as opposed to simply noticing them or noticing them in a different way. So it looks a little consistent. It has some features in there, but it's bleeding over some of these other assumptions that you have to control, regulate, diminish or get rid of thoughts or bleeding over to the work you're doing, which would diminish the coherence of work inside an ACT model. Now we're going to go into competency nine, which is detecting mindiness or entanglement with cognitions in session. This next segment will be with a college student who is facing career choices, still not certain about her major, and is sort of struggling with those alternatives. So what's inside this decision?",

Through all of these role plays, we'll be working with a client named Phil, who is a chronically depressed client who has come to therapy initially with a focus of really wanting to feel better about himself and that he hopes that when he's able to feel better about himself, he'll be able to then move on and move forward with his life. This segment reflects competency one in the Self as Context chapter, which refers to helping the client to distinguish the contents of consciousness from consciousness itself. And we're going to try to weave this in to the ongoing flow of the session. So, Phil, we've been working on this issue of you wanting to feel better about yourself. I mean, you came into therapy saying that that was something that you were really working hard to do, and you've been working on that for a long time.",

In particular, to help to discriminate that from his self as context or his sense of self as the observer. And this was meant to be an act consistent vignette. In this case, the focus was largely on helping the client to look at the way self as content tends to work, which is that it's difficult to find real peace at the level of self as content. And so what we did is we took some evaluations and brought them out to their extremes and saw that when you're operating with self evaluation, that as you become more positive, it tends to pull for negative. And as you think about more negative self evaluations, it tends to pull for more positive. And so we're wanting to help him just kind of start to notice and experience the difficulty in ever finding real peace at this level. This is competency 2. The therapist utilizes exercises to help the client make contact with self as context and distinguish that from self as content. This role play will be with Phil, who at this point in therapy, let's say it's the fourth session, he's come to therapy saying he wants to improve his self esteem, he wants to feel better about himself. And here we're going to see how the issue of distinguishing self as content is relevant to this situation.",

    "text": "And that's a thought too. This segment was an act consistent segment. And basically what I attempted to do was to help the client to slow down and step out of the content. Where the client began the segment. He was very wrapped up in his complaint about his life, and I had him stop and just notice what was showing up in the moment. A common way of helping to develop this discrimination between the self as content and self as context is to help the client notice what's present and then to help the client to notice the noticer or to notice the part of them that's observing or having all these things. There was a piece in the segment where I made a bit of an error by shifting from self as context, which refers to the sense of self as I here now. And I began to refer to the client as you there. And it would have been better to have had the client to refer to the client's experience and to talk about the idea of him being here, the you here now, now with the content being there. So I want you to imagine that this is like a chessboard that stretches in all directions. And on the chessboard are various pieces, just like in a chess game. You have the black pieces and you have the white pieces. And all the pieces on this board are, are your various experiences, your thoughts, your feelings, your memories, the sensations that you have. Those are all on this board. And they go to war. And you've been kind of going to war with these pieces for quite a while now. It's like you have these white pieces that you really like, which are the thoughts like that you're a good person and that you're competent and that you can, you know, move forward in your life. And these are these other, you know, the black pieces are these other pieces, you know, that are like questioning yourself or doubting yourself or feeling sad or hopeless. And these pieces are kind of put to war. And you try and really get aligned with the white pieces, you know, that I'm good, I'm competent, and try to kill off the black pieces. Okay, And I want to propose something in this metaphor, I want to propose that, that actually in this metaphor, you're not the pieces at all, but you're more like the board, more like the context or the arena where this war takes place. And what we need to do is find a way for you to be able to experience this place where you're the board.",

It wasn't terribly inconsistent, but it did have a few different aspects. The first aspect was that part of what the therapist recorded as a value was actually one more of a goal. And particularly, as you might have read in the chapter, a Dead Man Goal, the client said they wanted to not always be the one who's crying. And this is a sort of inactive, passive goal that are not of the sort that we want to have in relation to values. It's also a problem because it's a goal and not a value. The second part that was problematic in this segment was that it didn't have much of the qualities that we want to have as part of a powerful values conversation, like vitality, willing vulnerability, a present orientation. Those sort of qualities were not very much in there. In fact, the therapist was sort of laid back a bit and kind of, you know, behind their tablet of paper and that is engaged with the client in this segment. So, Julie, we spent a lot of time already talking about the different struggles that you've had with social anxiety and how you feel like you've been fighting this for a long time, and it really stands in the way of you kind of having the relationships that you want and you've been really working hard to overcome it.",

    "text": "Okay, so this was more of a hack, consistent vignette. And in this vignette, you saw the therapist focus more on the client's experience in the moment. And as this was an attempt to illustrate core competency number one, clarifying value directions, the focus was bringing some of these qualities of a powerful values conversation in the room, like vitality, choice. And you saw the therapist kind of hit on the issue of choice, at least initially, by asking the person to focus on what they would choose. And there was also more of a sense of connection and vitality in the conversation. Where the therapy might have gone next would have been, and perhaps this was an error to kind of pull away from this at the end would have been to go more into the experience of what it was like to be with her childhood friend and help the client to really get in contact with that experience in the moment, and then using that to help set up a choice in terms of whether that. Whether she would be willing to experience some of these difficult anxieties if we're able to serve that value. This vignette continues in what would be a later session with Julie after we've already worked on getting clear on the client's values. And this one focuses on core competency number four, which is helping the client to distinguish between outcomes achieved and involvement in the process of living. What we're going to do here is pick up at what would be the start of a session. And where this leads is that the week before, Julia has committed to some homework or some actions over the week that would be consistent with her values of connecting with people and. And being able to be sort of spontaneous and playful in interactions. And she noticed that one of the things that she does that gets in the way of that is she'll spend minutes or sometimes even hours preparing and maybe writing notes about what she's going to say to somebody before she goes into a conversation. And so the task was to let go of preparing like that and just to walk in to a conversation and to practice this on a daily basis at work this week. So, Julie, I thought we'd check in with. Start by checking in with what happened this week in terms of the commitment that you made.",

    "text": "So that was an act consistent piece. And again, it was competency for. In that I was trying to help the client to reconnect with the process that was being focused on in this rather than so attached to the outcome. What seemed to happen during the week was that the exercise sort of transformed from an exercise that was about getting her feet moving in this direction and into really an attachment to a particular goal that she sets for herself and sort of really is harsh with herself around, which is this goal of feeling like she's connected and feeling like people like her. And she got attached to that as she did the exercise and started to evaluate herself more in reference to that goal, rather than sort of appreciating the qualities of herself as moving towards this value direction while Letting go of barriers that often tend to stand in the way. Again, we return to core competency. Number one, helping the client define value directions. And this vignette is specifically focusing on the issue of goals versus values. And in this case, we're going to be having Derek, who is part of his goals for therapy, is having a better relationship with his wife. So, Derek, what is it that you want with your wife? You know, if you could just choose what you'd be about there, like, what would that be like? Quit arguing. Quit arguing. Resenting her. And what would you need to do to do that? Got it. I think I might have to start with disrespecting her. Just stop. You mean stop disrespecting her? Yes. Yeah. Okay. This is an act inconsistent vignette. The therapist started out fine with a question that could go either way, but the client gave a response which was more of an avoidance goal, or what we might call a dead man goal. A dead person is going to be able to do the job of not arguing better than this client is likely to be able to do. And we want to come up with goals which have a sense of. And values which have a sense of what's the client moving towards rather than what's the client moving away from. And by the therapist accepting this goal as something to orient towards, we're likely to be feeding that process of moving away. And, Derek, what would you want in your relationship with your wife? I mean, if your relationship could be about anything, if you could be about anything in that relationship, you could just choose it. What would you choose? Stop. Stop resenting her. And if you were able to stop resenting her, like, what would your relationship like? If you could just imagine that, like, that you just got to that place magically, that you weren't resenting her anymore and you weren't fighting anymore, what would you hope that this relationship would look like and how you'd be in it? I think communicating, understanding, and doing things we used to do. So both of you would be communicating and understanding. Yeah. And specifically you from your side. Like, if you were able to sort of let go and that resentment sort of just sort of magically evaporated, you'd be more connected and present. More present. Yeah. More fulfilling, more fulfilled, perhaps as, like, an outcome. But maybe you don't have a choice over that. But you'd be. But, like, you might have more of a choice over whether you're going to be present or not. Exactly. There for her. Yeah, there for her. That would be part of the picture that's exactly it. Yeah. And her for me as well, just to enjoy simple things. Right. So that would be part of the vision. Exactly. I mean, I'm really striving for that. So that was an act consistent vignette. Again, focusing on the issue of developing goals that would be more approach type goals. The client originally came and presented a goal that was more of an avoidance goal initially. And my job was to help the client to contact what is the value and the quality of action that might be perhaps behind that goal. And so I sort of sidestepped the initial statement and asked, if you were to achieve that goal, then what would you hope things would be like? In an effort to hopefully draw out what are the client's dreams and the hopes, hopefully something that the client could attach or connect to in a more powerful way than just not arguing anymore.",

    "text": "Yeah. Just to orient, of course. In dialectical behavior therapy, we have a treatment target hierarchy. There's a set of targets that we've collaboratively agreed upon already. We would have done that in the first couple of sessions and out of that collaborative endeavor would have created a self monitoring diary card where the different things that we're working on are on a piece of paper that. Are we calling you Andrea or are we calling you Alice? Alice. That Alice would be ideally paying attention to every day. She's practicing noticing a variety of things. In this particular case, given her targets that are in the vignette, she's paying attention every day to rating. Does she have suicidal thoughts? Does she have suicidal urges? Does she actually self harm? Is she restricting her eating? How many hours of sleep is she getting? What is the quality of her relationships? Every day. And she's doing this every day, ideally. The other thing we put on this is a little thing that patients fill out just before they come into session that varies from patient to patient, what it might be. But for someone with her particular targets, there'd just be a little box there. It would say her urges, right now, right at this moment coming into session, her urge is to kill herself or to self harm. Her urges to restrict eating, because that's one of her targets. If she were a substance user, it would be urges to use substances, always urges to quit therapy. Okay. And then for somebody who's as affiliative as she is, we'd also have something like how connected does she feel to me? Okay. She'd rate that at the very beginning of the session, usually like in the waiting room before she comes in. And we'd have her rate it again just before leaving the session. Okay. And that would give us something that, if there are big changes in the wrong direction, that would give us something to pick up on the following week. So let's assume that there's. Yeah, let's assume that we left the last session. Now the thing is that with a third session, I think I'd like to make this maybe like a fifth session or sixth session, if that's okay. Because the first three or four sessions in DBT are this orienting and establishing collaborative enterprise, a commitment to treatment and establishing what the targets are. So I'd rather assume that we've actually already done that. We're actually in the treatment now. Okay. And so the diary card gives us, of course, a picture of what's been going on for the whole week and allows us then to organize the session, structure the session within the Hierarchy. So if there's something that's life threatening in dbt, we. We would prioritize. That doesn't mean that's the only thing that we would do in the session, but we would start with that. If there's nothing life threatening going on this past week or currently this moment, then we could look at treatment, interfering behaviors. And then if there's nothing going on there, we then look within quality of life things like eating disorder behavior and problems in her relationship with her boyfriend, and a variety of other things. Drug use or whatever it might be, housing problems, problems at school or work, whatever it might be. Okay, good enough. Well, how things are going in your relationships with friends. And, yeah, 10 is. Yeah, you can do it from like minus 10 to positive 10 or however you want. And diary cards, of course, are developed idiosyncratically, you know, so Alice would have a different diary card than somebody else. And even this month, Alice's diary card is going to look different in six months from now as things change. Her diary card will reflect some of those changes as our shift in focus continues over time. So. Perfect. Thank you. Okay, so actually, why don't you hold on to this? You just come in and give it to me, because that's what you'd actually do. So come on. Hi, Alice.",

And in other words, avoidance is one of the barriers. What we just did there was sort of pointing out that pain can be a guide. Pain indicates two things. Yes, you've had things that have hurt, but you also have cared. If you didn't care, the things would not hurt. And so, ironically, as you avoid, you have to avoid not just your hurts, but also what it is you really care about, what you really want. And so we were looping up from the barrier and having it be part of a pattern of committed action rather than an indication that she can't go in this direction. And so I kind of have a sense that you're holding your boyfriend at bay a little bit. You take one step forward and then one or two steps back. Am I wrong in that?",

I joined with her and let her know that she was not alone by disclosing that I, too, sometimes have those experiences.

Finally, it opens the room up for the two of us to work together on any way that this particular experience of failure or incompetence might show up in the room, we'll be aware of it.

    "text": "So in this last clip, there was a very subtle thing happening. We did move into problem solving, which in and of a of itself isn't necessarily a problem. In fact, problem solving could be quite consistent with something that you're doing in act. In this particular case, though, the client was expressing a fairly emotional piece of content. She was talking about her father criticizing her, and at one point, she even seemed to be on the verge of tears. I missed an opportunity there to connect with the client in a powerful way by taking an in the moment time for our relationship to develop by recognizing that emotion that's there, being willing to tolerate the emotion that's there. Another issue that might be at hand when a client begins to get emotional is that sometimes it's hard for the therapist too. Let's say, for instance, I had a critical father, and it was hard for me to experience that criticalness. I might quickly then move into problem solving as a way to escape my own emotional experience and lose the willingness in the moment. So the best approach in this one would have been to stay with the issue at hand, the emotion at hand longer, and be willing to experience what the therapist is experiencing too. Additionally, this is related to core competency number nine, where we were talking about the processes that occur in the moment. In this session, I missed those processes that are relevant and act consistent in this Next clip, we'll be looking at Core Competency 1 here. We'll be working with the client from a perspective that they are completely able at this point in time. They have all that they need to move forward in their life in a valued way.",

And traditionally, and still very commonly in the addiction field, Addiction counselors, Many of them have background as addicts themselves. And so there's this whole hardcore approach. Of breaking through resistance, Breaking through denial. People have to be abstinent. This is a very different approach. It is a different approach. The others have certainly been traditional. And perhaps for some people, those have been effective. But in motivational interviewing, we really want the client to be the one who determines if they have a problem. And we want to give them full opportunity to be able to examine this. And then if they decide that this issue, drinking, in this case, is a problem, to then help that person decide what their goals are around that. So it could be that Sarah decides over time, as she begins to do in this clip, that she wants to try to moderate, she wants to go to harm reduction. So we really want the client to establish their own goals. And this is a different approach. Than has been traditional often in the addictions field. And so when Dr. Miller first began his work in motivational interviewing, it was quite revolutionary for him to approach the client from this direction.",

I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married and you were very busy and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. And then when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, somehow your symptoms then will seem greater.

I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking and the fact that you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth us sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalise them a little bit and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse. I guess. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference?",

And there are some very simple relaxation exercises that I can teach you that I'd like you to go away and practice by next week when you come. You'll practice those relaxation exercises because they're things that you can use anyway in any situation. What are they lying on the floor? Well, I'll tell you what they are. No, you don't have to lie on the floor. Not for these, because that's not very practical. Just before you go and smell your cereal box. So what I suggest is we look at you coming back in a week's time and you'll have practiced the relaxation exercises. We'll go through them again and we perhaps do another role play and then maybe we might be ready to go and do it for real. What do you think? Okay, that sounds good.",

Because I suppose you told me last week that you're quite frightened about having these panic attacks in different situations. That was the third questionnaire that I gave you.

And I think that's, again, one of the things that this has been useful is to kind of fill in some of the blanks that we didn't get to talk about last week.

    "text": "Okay. All right. As we can see from that scenario, Ian was quite depressed and feeling quite helpless and hopeless and was admitting to having constant suicidal ideation or thinking about that he wanted his problems to stop, although he wasn't saying that he was actually wanting to die. Now, what would be important is to take enough time to actually do a thorough risk assessment. And it was clear that I hadn't been able to get all the information that I would like to. In the brief 10 minutes that you saw, some of the things that will be important to get from Ian would be whether he would actually make an attempt in that how likely did he feel that he would actually act on his thoughts? So asking things like, you know, how likely do you feel that you would act on the thoughts that you're having? So if you were to go home now, how likely do you feel that you might actually take the antidepressants and how many do you think you would take? The other thing to ask him would be whether he'd actually done a trial run, whether he'd taken any extra antidepressants and how that had gone, and hopefully this is something that I would have done in an assessment interview with him was to find out whether he'd had any previous attempts of suicide and what those attempts entailed. Now, Ian had said that he would phone his brother. However, it was unclear as to when he might do that or how safe he was at that point in time. So the other thing I'd want to find out is the imminence of the risk. So how likely he felt he was going to act on these thoughts, in addition to then maybe making sure that he actually phoned his brother whilst I was in the room with him. Because sometimes clients will say, yes, they'll do this, but they may then leave the room and actually not do this. So the really important thing to think about is how safe is this client to leave your office on their own? He mentioned a couple of protective factors in that he didn't want to hurt himself because of his children or his family. And these are always important things to find out. And his support structure in who was around that could help him over the time where he was feeling at his most vulnerable. The other thing that you may have noticed when you watched the video was that I tried to engage him in trying to think of solutions and to get involved with what might help him to feel better and what might help him at that point in time. Because often clients who are feeling suicidal or feeling that there's no hope kind of lose their ability to feel that they can make decisions or actually take action within their life. So trying to engender that is a really helpful thing to do and engenders hope. The other thing to think about when you're doing risk assessment is that it usually takes longer. And you could see with Ian, he was quite depressed and it took him quite a while to open up and to talk about what was going on for him. So if you have another client booked in right after, you've got to think about that. This is going to upset your timetable. You can't just say, well, the hour has ended, and okay, off you go. Because again, you've got to ask yourself, is this client safe to leave? So it just takes as long as it needs to take for you to get all the information that you need. Thinking about the means is another thing that's important. He mentioned that he was taking antidepressants, and having knowledge about how lethal the means are that a client is thinking about is important. So, for instance, if they're saying they're going to shoot themselves, finding out whether they actually have access to a gun or whether they know how a gun works or whether they have access to bullets are things that are important to ask. So knowing the lethality of the means is another important thing to think about and to find out. So there's quite a number of things that you need to find out when you're doing a risk assessment. It's the intent, how serious are they and how soon do they think they might act on these thoughts that they're having, the means that they're going to use, how they're going to do it and how lethal the means are, whether they've had any previous attempts, what support structures they've got, and whether there are any protective factors that might prevent them from actually acting on their thoughts.",

    "text": "This interview with Kevin was really an example of working with a mandated client. And by that we mean a client who probably hasn't come in through their own free will. In this case, his wife, Lydia, made an ultimatum that unless he came into therapy, she would be leaving the relationship. So, in a way, we've got another client in the room, Lydia. Even though she's not physically here, her presence is very much felt by the therapist, because we know she's sitting out there in the waiting room or at home or wherever she might be expecting that this psychologist is going to be able to make a significant difference to her husband's behaviour. So in these kind of situations with mandated clients, it's particularly important to be able to build a good rapport with the client, because they don't really want to be here, they don't really see what the problem is. And although Kevin didn't act overtly in any way hostile or defensive about being here, he couldn't really see the point. And so I needed to put special emphasis on that relationship with him. Of course, the issue is that he was behaving in ways, as it unfolded during the session, that were really quite aggressive and not appropriate. But I was hoping that my judgment of those behaviors would not be overt so that he felt that I was criticizing him or judging him, because that would be a real risk of him closing down. So what I was trying to do then is build rapport, maintain rapport with him, to not judge him, but at the same time to get as much information as I can. In the back of my mind, I was wondering about what the extent of his aggressive behaviour was towards Lydia and the children. And so part of that segment was an example of an exploration of aggressive or domestic violence type of behavior. You would have noticed that during the session that Kevin really demonstrated two of the major defences during domestic violence situations, that he was minimising the effect and extent of his behaviour and also minimizing the consequences of it, and to some extent, also denying issues. So he wasn't that forthcoming. It needed to, almost. One had to ask the right questions for him to acknowledge that he'd even hit her. So he would acknowledge some of the things that he thought wasn't too bad, like pushing and shoving and shouting. And also initially he was saying that it was both of them. It was only after some time with very specific questioning that he acknowledged that it was largely him, particularly with the more intimidating behaviours, which is fairly typical of doing an interview in domestic violence. Part of that was also an attempt at a motivational assessment to see just how ready he was for therapy. And it would be interesting for you to have a think about? Well, what do you think is the likelihood that if Kevin was a real client, that he would engage in therapy? And what do you think are some of the big blocks and big pluses that he might do well or not in therapy? So, on the one hand, he's got a motivation that his wife will leave him and it looks like he believes her. But on the other hand, he doesn't see that his behaviour is a problem. Which also means that there isn't a shared conceptualization between the therapist and the. The client, because the therapist obviously think that there is a large number of problems in his behaviour. So those are just some of the issues for you to have a think about.",

    "text": "Good. Okay. Gifts represent a bit of a tricky situation in therapy. What I thought was happening in this situation was that this client was maybe getting a little bit confused about the nature of the therapeutic relationship and starting to get a little bit confused about boundaries. This is understandable, given his relationship history and what's happening outside of therapy, that once he does experience a positive relationship, he might misinterpret it. The other option is that he actually is just grateful for the work we're doing together and wanted to express that gratitude and there was nothing else behind it. What I chose to do in this situation was to accept the wine but leave it on the table. So I wasn't actually accepting it as a personal gift to me. What I was very mindful of, though, was actually not demonstrating that this was a rejection of him. So what I wanted to do was very much validate the reasons for choosing to give me the wine and express his gratitude, but also make it very clear that this is a therapeutic relationship and that there are boundaries here and. And that what he will need to do in future is actually work at establishing relationships outside of therapy. What I could have also done with this is explore what his motivation was in choosing to give me the wine. However, just at the beginning of the session, I thought that might be perhaps a little bit too confrontational for him, especially as I wasn't quite sure whether it was a personal gift or just an expression of gratitude. But that is something that I could have addressed later in the session or even at a different stage of therapy. This did present a bit of an ethical situation in that the gift was alcohol. And depending on the agency that I work for or the broader context, that has an effect on how I could accept the gift. Something I could have said to him was that I would share the wine with colleagues at a meeting that evening to indicate that I wasn't rejecting it, but it wasn't a personal gift to me. The other thing I would be aware of is being quite mindful of similar gestures towards me in therapy. And so if I saw repetitions of this sort of behaviour. I might need to address that in future.",

One of the things that I hope you did see in that short vignette that you just saw was that although the therapist at some times was engaged with the client and was being somewhat empathic, the therapist was also very, very keen to move off topic, found the distress that the client was showing very difficult to tolerate, and was very keen to move away from that subject matter. And even though the client continually pulled the therap back to the discussion of her own flaws and the problems with the breakup with her boyfriend, the therapist really wasn't getting the message there and persisted in trying to derail what the client wanted to talk about and move the content of the session away from the breakup with the boyfriend.",

You had mentioned that some people in your life have kind of commented, and they said maybe you ought to look into thinking about whether or not you have some issues with anger or not. And that's one of the reasons you're here. And I'm hoping that this will help sort of identify specific issues related to anger that might be problematic for you. And so this is really feedback meant for you. You. You can do whatever you like with the information. It's just for you to consider it. So let's go through each area. There are a number of questions here and a number of sort of different anger dimensions. And I think the place we're going to start is if you look at all the questions that you answered, it comes up with something called a total score, which is just kind of looking at everything together. And when we look at the total score, you scored quite high, actually. You scored in a range that we would sort of call the 99th percentile, which means that your anger is at a level greater than 99% of the population of men your age. Are you kidding me? Yeah. That's kind of hard.",

    "text": "Okay, so I've just finished being a therapist for auf, who presented as a man with midlife crisis type issues and was concerned that as a young therapist I wouldn't be able to understand his experiences because I haven't myself been through them. And I guess this is something as a young therapist and starting out was always a big anxiety for me and I guess something that has had to be overcome. And I realised that going through life we can't experience every single thing and we're always going to have clients come in with something you haven't yourself been through. So I guess for me, it was just about saying to myself, I can still offer these people something and I can still help them. And I can at least, I guess, have some understanding and empathy for what they're going through. And I think that that is the most important thing in this part. I think it was important for me to really process that with Alf. I think I would have lost him out of therapy if we didn't address it head on. To start with, I feel that the therapy itself in that section went well. I think we came to a point where we could perhaps leave that issue aside for now and progress further. And with that in mind, constantly as a therapist. The process then being. Trying to illustrate to him all the time. Empathy through my reflection of his feelings all the time. To show him, I guess, that I can get it. Or if I don't, at least asking him and checking in with him to see whether I'm on the right page. It was confronting as a therapist, and it probably always will be. You have that slight, kind of your heart flutters a little bit. Because you feel like you're being challenged. I think the most important thing for me was to not react to that in a defensive way. And try and justify myself to him. But to really focus on what was going on for him. Which I think started off a nice modeling of that. This is always going to be what's going on for him. And I'll always be wanting to know that. So whatever comes up for him and he feels that I don't understand. That was a nice starting point for him.",

Instead of becoming defensive and shutting down, the patient felt free to explore the options available to him. This interaction was more pleasant for both the patient and the provider, and it helped to move the patient from not even considering a change to thinking about what a change might mean for him. This is a crucial first step in the change process. As a result, it is likely that this patient will return to speak with his provider when he begins preparing to make a quit attempt.",

Once the parent felt completely defeated, she caved in, announced that she would quit smoking. It is clear to any observer that this parent had no intention to quit smoking at this time, but rather that she was simply attempting to bring an end to the uncomfortable confrontation. In this case, the provider wasted an excellent opportunity to work with a mother who was expressing a real desire to quit smoking, coupled with a lack of confidence in her ability to do so. By listening to what the parent was really saying, the provider might have been able to help this parent develop a workable plan. In addition, both the provider and parent would have felt.

Okay. So we'll take an example. Like, tell me about the last time that you were feeling depressed.",

You know that the situation, the thought, the emotion and your reaction to it. But another thing I'd like for you to do is if you can schedule one event a day that you would enjoy doing and it couldn't be a phone call, it doesn't have to be getting out. And give yourself a break. Know that this is going to be difficult and you're going to start out slow and you're going to work up to it. But just one event a day. I want you to log as well. You know, where there is. I called my kids or I called my buddy to schedule something or I went to work out. All right? And I also would like for you to write down how you felt about yourself after you did that, after the phone call, how you felt about yourself after the workout, how it made you feel, alright? After you got together with your buddies. All right, so go ahead and document this progression and then log the different activities that you. And then we'll talk about it next week. We can talk about what's, you know, these automatic thoughts and then any of these activities. And if any of these activities are actually helping, it might take a while. Tommy, you have to be patient with the process. Be patient with yourself and other people. I mean, you mentioned a while ago that your buddies, you know, they tried connecting with you and it was maybe difficult. They'll probably be glad that you're wanting to re engage with them. So that might be encouragement to you as well. So is this something that you can think you can work on this week? Yeah. Okay. Does it feel overwhelming or.",

I think this CBT really helps you think about, you know, what's going on and why am I feeling this way, you know, identifying the thoughts in your mind and why I might be thinking of this and why I'm reacting because of this. And you might even rate your emotion and say, yesterday I felt, you know, my feeling of worthlessness on a scale from 1 to 100 was 90, but today it's actually 80, and maybe next week it might be 70. So if you want to add a particular number to associate your association with that feeling, you know, of worthlessness, if you want to kind of put a value on it, you know, and we can kind of see. See how that adjusts with time, that might be a helpful.",
